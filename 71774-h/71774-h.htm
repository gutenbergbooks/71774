</div>


<p>In the course of preparing the material for the
following sketch, I was brought into very agreeable
relations <span id='cor_v'>with</span> many persons whose practical experience
in library work proved of exceptional value
to me. I wish to take this means of thanking Miss
Annie Carroll Moore, Supervisor of Children’s
Rooms in the New York Public Library, and Mr.
C. G. Leland, Supervisor of School Libraries and
member of the New York Board of Education, for
every encouragement and assistance.</p>

<p>To Miss Caroline M. Hewins of the Hartford
Public Library, Miss Frances Jenkins Olcott of
the Pittsburgh Carnegie Library, Miss Caroline
Burnite of the Cleveland Public Library, the Reverend
Joseph McMahon, a member of the Advisory
Board of the New York Public Library, Mr. Frederic
W. Erb of the Columbia University Library,
and to Mr. Tudor Jenks, I am indebted for general
advice.</p>

<p>In special lines, I had the privilege of consultation
with Mr. Frank Damrosch, Mr. C. Whitney Coombs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
and Miss Kate Cohen for music; Miss Emilie Michel
for French; and Miss Hedwig Hotopf for German.</p>

<p>The librarians of Columbia University, the Pratt
Institute, and the Astor Library have rendered me
marked service for which I am grateful.</p>

<p>I wish to thank the New York <cite>Outlook</cite>, <cite>Independent</cite>,
and <cite>Evening Post</cite> for affording me opportunities
to publish from time to time data relating to juvenile
books and reading.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to fix the responsibility for whatever
statements are made in the way of criticism upon
myself; this is only due to those whose extensive
knowledge of the subject is being exerted in a professional
capacity; and to those many authors whose
books and papers are indicated in the bibliographical
notes.</p>

<p>The field of children’s books is by no means an
uninterrupted host of dancing daffodils; it is
not yellow with imperishable gold. In fact, there is
a deplorable preponderance of the sere and yellow
leaf. Yet there is no fairer opportunity for the
writer than that which offers itself in the voluntary
spirit of a boy or girl reader. Here are to be met
no crotchets or fads, no prejudices or unthinkable
canons of art. Because the body is surcharged
with surplus energy necessary to growth, because the
mind is throwing out delicate tendrils that foreshadow
its potential future, one realises how vital
is the problem of children’s reading, how significant
the manner in which it is being handled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>At the outset, it is essential for us to distinguish
between theory, history, and practice. The field,
with all its rich soil, is in need of weeding. Not so
very long ago, it lay unrecognised by the library,
as of sufficient importance for separate and specialised
consideration. But now, with the prominence
being given to children’s reading-rooms, the field
needs to be furrowed. Let us not ignore the salubrious
under-stratum of the past; it has served its
mission in asserting the claims of childhood; it has
both negatively and positively marked the individuality
of childhood, in a distinctive juvenile literature.
Perhaps the writers who were inspired by the Rousseau
doctrine of education, and those who abetted
the Sunday-school movement of the last century,
were deceived in their attitude; for they considered
the machinery by which they hoped to mould character,
rather than the nature of the heart and soul
upon which they were actually working. A right
action, a large, human, melodramatic deed, are
more healthy for boys and girls than all the reasons
that could be given for them. In literature for
children, as in life, the moral <cite>habit</cite> should be unquestioning.
All leading educators and ethical
teachers recognise this fact.</p>

<p>The whole matter simply resolves itself into a
difference in viewpoint between the past and present.
Smile as we must over the self-conscious piousness
of early juvenile literature, it contained a great deal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
of sincerity; it did its pioneer work excellently well.
To the writer of children’s books, to the home,
where one essential duty is personal guidance, to
the librarian whose work is not the science of
numbers, but a profession of culture-distributing,
some knowledge of the past harvests from this field
would appear indispensable. For the forgotten tales
of long ago, the old-fashioned stories represent something
more than stained pages and crude woodcuts,
than stilted manners and seeming priggishness; they
stand for the personal effort and service of men and
women striving with staunch purpose in the interests
of childhood, however mistaken their estimates of
this childhood may have been. These books, to
the library, are so much fallow material as a practical
circulating proposition, but they represent forces
significant in the history of children’s books. I
would much rather see a librarian fully equipped
with a knowledge of Miss Edgeworth’s life, of her
human associations, together with the inclinations
prompting her to write “The Parent’s Assistant,”
than have her read a whole list of moral tales of the
same purport and tone.</p>

<p>The immediate problem, therefore, necessitates a
glance at this field of children’s literature, and some
knowledge of its essential details. It involves a contact
with books of all grades; it calls into play, with
the increasing number of libraries, and with the
yearly addition of children’s rooms, a keen discerning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
judgment on the part of the librarian, not only as
to child nature, but as to the best methods of elimination,
by which bad books may be separated from
good, and by which the best may preponderate.
But the librarian is not the only factor; the parent
and the writer also come into account. They, too,
must share a responsibility which will be more fully
determined later on, but which now means that they
both owe the child an indispensable duty; the one
in giving to the growing boy or girl most intelligent
guidance along the path of fullest development;
the other in satisfying this need—not in deflecting
juvenile taste by means of endless mediocrity and
mild sentimentalism. It is an unfortunate circumstance
that the effects of mediocrity are longer-lived
than the immediate evil itself.</p>

<p>In the problem of children’s reading we must
consider two aspects; there is the bogey image of
a theoretical or sociological or educational child,
and also the book as a circulating commodity. There
is the machinery of “The Child”; Dr. Isaac Watts
shaped one; Jean Jacques Rousseau another; the
Edgeworths still another, and now the psychologist’s
framework of childhood, more subtle, more scientific,
more interesting, threatens us everywhere.
But no patent has so far supplanted the fundamental
excellence of human nature. There are assuredly
demarkations and successive steps in elementary
education, but are not these becoming too specialised?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Since we are dealing with the Boy and the Story
rather than with the Scholar and the Text-book,
with culture which is personal, and not with expediency,
we needs must choose the human model in
preference to all others.</p>

<p>And so it is with the choice of the librarian. In
dealing with books in the bulk, there is a tendency
to emphasise system above the humanising excellence
of what the books contain. After all the mechanical
detail is done, when the cover has been labelled,
when the catalogue notation has been figured, when
the class distribution has been determined, the
librarian stands middleman in a threefold capacity.
She is a purveyor, in the sense that she passes a book
over the counter; she is a custodian, in so far as
books need protection; she is the high priestess,
since the library is a temple of treasures, a storehouse
for our literary heritage. In any library,
whether it be yours at home, with your own books
upon the shelves, or the public’s, with volumes
representing so much of your taxation on which you
base your citizenship, the rare companionship of
books is one of their humanising qualities. This
is as much a truth for children as for grown-ups.</p>

<p>With the fear that there is an effort on the part of
many to crystallise reading into a science, comes the
necessity to foster a love of reading for its own sake.
The democracy of books has grown larger with the
cheapening process of manufacture; while the establishment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
of public libraries offers to every one an
equal privilege. In an assemblage of many books,
a certain spiritual dignity should attach itself to the
utilitarian fact.</p>

<p>There is no definition for children’s books; the
essential point is appeal, interest. As far back as
1844, a writer in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> very aptly
claimed that “a genuine child’s book is as little like
a book for grown people cut down, as the child himself
is like a little old man.” Peculiarly, there is a
popular misconception that an author of juveniles
advances in art only when he or she leaves off penning
stories or fairy tales, and begins publishing novels.
On the face of it, this is absurd. Like any other
gift, writing for children cannot be taught; it has to
be born. If possible, with the exception of drama,
it is the most difficult art to master, since its narrative
will not stand imitation, since its simplicity must
represent naturalness and not effort, since its meaning
must be within reach, and without the tone of
condescension.</p>

<p>Professor Richard Burton has written: “A piece
of literature is an organism, and should, therefore,
be put before the scholar, no matter how young, with
its head on, and standing on both feet.” This
injunction applies to all books. Where the classics
excel is in their very fulness and honesty of narrative.
Can the same be said of our “series” brand?</p>

<p>The writing of children’s books is more aptly phrased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the writing of books for children. There was a time
when such books, as a class by themselves, were
unknown; yet boys and girls expanded, and perhaps
remembered more of what they read than they do
to-day, although they were not taught as much.
There are some pessimists, not so unwise in their
pessimism, who believe that if less emphasis was
bestowed upon the word <em>children</em>, and more upon
the word <em>literature</em>, the situation would be materially
bettered.</p>

<p>Can we recall any of our great men—literary,
scientific, or otherwise—who were brought up on
distinctively juvenile literature. A present-day boy
who would read what Lamb or Wordsworth, Coleridge
or Tennyson, Gladstone or Huxley devoured with
gusto in their youth, would set the psychologists in
a flutter, would become an object for head-lines in
our papers. There is a mistaken conception regarding
what are children’s books, in the best sense
of the word. A standard which might have excellent
conservative results, although it would be thoroughly
one-sided and liable to false interpretation, could be
based on the assertion that those books only are
children’s classics which can be relished by a grown-up
public. “Alice in Wonderland,” “The Water
Babies,” “Peter Pan”—such stories have a universal
appeal. And it is well to remember that at least
five of the world’s classics, not originally written for
children, have been appropriated by them: “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Arabian Nights”; “Pilgrim’s Progress”; “Robinson
Crusoe”; “Gulliver’s Travels”; “Baron Münchausen.”</p>

<p>With the reading democracy created by public
libraries, there has developed the need for this
special kind of writing. Excesses have unfortunately
arisen such as made a critic once exclaim in
disgust, “Froissart is cut into spoon-meat, and
Josephus put into swaddling clothes.” While we
shall, in the following pages, find many odd theories
and statements regarding simplification of style,
it is as well to be forearmed against this species of
writing. Democracy in literature is falsely associated
with mediocrity. When one reads the vitiating
“series” class of story-book, the colourless college record,
the diluted historical narrative, there is cause for
despair. But there is no need for such cheapening.
The wrong impression is being created in the popular
mind that literature is synonymous with dulness;
that only current fiction is worth while. And
we find children confessing that they rarely read
non-fiction, a term they only dimly comprehend.
It is not right that a middle-class population should
have relegated to it a middle-class literature. Such,
however, at the present moment, seems to be the
situation. And as a consequence all departments
suffer. Except for a very few volumes, there is no
biography for children that is worthy of endorsement,
for the simple reason that the dignity of a whole life,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
its meaning and growth, are subordinated to the
accentuation of a single incident. History becomes
a handmaiden to the slender story. Let those
writers who are looking for an unworked vein ponder
this. The fictionising of all things is one of the
causes for this poverty; the text-book habit another.</p>

<p>The poet Blake sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thou hast a lap full of seed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this is a fine country.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why dost thou not cast thy seed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And live in it merrily?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class='no-indent'>But, though we are repeatedly casting our seed in the
field of juvenile literature, we are not reaping the
full harvest, because we are not living in the land of
childhood merrily.</p>

<p>Start as you will to treat of children’s books as
the mere vehicle for giving joy, and education
will pursue you. Acknowledging all the benefits
that the moral tale and the instructive walk have
bestowed, we know not which to pity most—the
child in a moral strait-jacket, or the child observing
nature! The terms we use in describing these
writers of a past generation are always the same;
they are not prepossessing, though they may sound
quaint. We turn from such critical phrases as
“flabby treatment of the Bible,” “dear, didactic,
deadly dull” Mrs. Barbauld, Miss Edgeworth’s
“overplus of sublime purpose,” to definite terms
of protest such as those of the “Professor at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Breakfast Table,” condemning the little meek
sufferers with their spiritual exercises, and those of
Emerson ending in his cry of “What right have you
to <em>one</em> virtue!” The mistaken attitude, which has
slipped from the moral to the educational sphere,
seems to be that self-development is not just as important
as prescribed courses. While the latter are
necessary to the school, the librarian must reckon
differently; for, to her, the child is not so much a
class as a unit.</p>

<p>Elementary education is marked by the compulsory
factor; in reading, a child’s interest is voluntary.
On the other hand, the severity of a Puritan Sunday,
the grimness of a New England Primer, developed
in childhood sound principles of righteousness;
they erected a high fence between heaven and hell.
But the moral tale utilised “little meannesses of
conventional life,” suggested sly deceit and trivial
pettiness; it quibbled and its ethics were often doubtful.
The reaction that followed let slip a valuable
adjunct in culture; to-day the knowledge of the
Bible in schools and colleges is appallingly shallow;
this fact was revealed in the results of an examination
or test held by President Thwing some years ago.
Dr. Felix Adler, pleading from the non-sectarian
platform, asks for the re-establishment of ethics
in our schools as a study of social relations, and for
the extended use of Bible stories, shorn of religious
meaning, yet robbed of none of their essential strength
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
or beauty or truth. The librarian has wisely mapped
out for her story hour such a course, gleaned from the
parables, and from the vast treasure houses of narrative
abounding in both Testaments and in fables.</p>

<p>Turn to your colleges and your schools, and you will
find that, generally speaking, there is dug a deep channel
between literature and life, which has no right to
be. We should study our ethics as one of the inherent
elements in poetry and in prose. The moral
<em>habit</em> is part of the structure of the Arthurian legends.</p>

<p>Since the time of Rousseau the emancipation of
the child has steadily advanced; in society, he has
taken his place. No longer is it incumbent upon
him to be seen and not heard, no longer are his answers
written out for him to memorise. Mr. E. V.
Lucas, in the preface to his “Forgotten Tales of
Long Ago,” calls attention to one story, “Ellen and
George; or, The Game at Cricket,” culled from
“Tales for Ellen,” by Alicia Catherine Mant, and
in a characteristically droll manner he says, “Ellen’s
very sensible question (as it really was) on p. 184,
‘Then why don’t you send the cat away?’ is one of
the first examples of independent—almost revolutionary—thought
in a child, recorded by a writer
for children in the early days.”</p>

<p>But the chains that have fallen from one door have
been threatening to shackle another. Where once
children could scarcely escape the moral, their imaginations
now have no room for flight. Fancy is bestrided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
by fact. We must give reasons for everything.
When Artemus Ward was asked why the
summer flowers fade, he exclaimed, “Because it’s
their biz, let ’em fade.” In nature study for children
the general effect leaves a deeper impression than
the technical structure. We do not know whether
it is necessary to have Mr. Seton’s “Story of Wahb”
vouched for as to accuracy in every detail. The
scientific naturalists and story-writers are constantly
wrangling, but there is not so much harm done to
nature after all. An author who wilfully perverts
fact, who states as true for the class what he knows
to be a variant in the one coming under his observation,
should be called to account. Otherwise a
human interest attached to animals creates a wide
appeal. But to use this vehicle for exploiting the
commonplace, and what properly belongs to the text-book,
should be condemned by the librarian. Mr.
Tudor Jenks<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> humorously declares: “We ask our
little ones to weep over the tribulations of a destitute
cock-roach or a bankrupt tumble-bug.” And
another critic of an earlier age writes of those same
children—“They are delighted, it is true, with the
romantic story of ‘Peter, the wild boy,’ but they
have not the slightest curiosity to know the natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
history, or Linnæan nomenclature of the pig-nuts
he ate.”</p>

<p>The following pages have been written after some
extensive investigation. Within the past few years,
about fifteen hundred of the latest books for children
have come to my desk; they have not been without
meaning for the present, or without connection with
the past. While it has not been the intention to write
a full history of children’s books, some idea is
given of the extent and possibilities of the field;
the historical development is sketched in outline.
There is need for a comprehensive volume. In addition,
an attempt is here made to reconcile system
with culture; to discover what the library is aiming
to do with juvenile readers in the community; to
show the relation which the Library, the School, and
the Home, bear, one to the other, and all to the child.
Having carefully examined lists of books recommended
by libraries for children of all ages and grades, a
limited number of volumes, marked by an excellence
which makes them worthy of preservation, is recommended
as suitable for boys and girls. These titles are
given in an appendix. The fault with most lists of this
character is that they too often represent the choice of
one person. To counteract this one-sidedness, the co-operation
of an advisory board was obtained, marked
by wide experience, by an intimate contact with and
knowledge of the books considered, and by a desire
to show a human respect for the tastes of children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>There are certain phases in the consideration of
the departments that have been suggested by young
readers themselves. The desire for books about
musicians, and for piano and violin scores, brought
to light the lack of any guaranteed assemblage of
songs which, in variety, in quality, in sentiment and
imagination, might be called distinctive. The interest
in a certain type of drawing as shown by the juvenile
demand for Boutet de Monvel, Kate Greenaway,
and Caldecott picture-books, suggested the advisability
of including a full list of these publications.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
One cannot approach the subject with any ironclad
rules, yet it is always profitable to heed experiments
based on common sense. The results of such experiments
are but mileposts in the general advance;
they must not be taken as final. Yet it is well to
experiment in order to avoid crystallisation.</p>

<p>Children are entitled to their full heritage; education
is paramount, culture is the saving grace.
Your memory of a child is the healthy glow of the
unfettered spirit. None of us want him with a book
in his hand all the time. We wish him to take the
freshness of life as his nature, to run with hair tossing
to the wind. But glance into his eyes and you will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
find a craving look that a ball will not satisfy, a
far-away expression that no shout from the roadside
will change. It is the placid gleam of sunset after
physical storm, the moment of rest after the overflow
of animal energy. Children have their hero moments
when they are not of the present, but are part of that
perennial truth which is clearer-visioned in the past,
since we have to dream of it. Kate Douglas Wiggin
claims that the book is a fact to a child. It should
be an idealising fact.</p>

<p>Not long ago a crazy man died, after having drawn
up a will: his world’s goods consisted of the wide, wide
world; his legatees were every living soul. He said:</p>

<p>“I leave to children, inclusively, but only for the
term of their childhood, all and every, the flowers of
the fields, and the blossoms of the woods, with the
right to play among them freely, according to the
customs of children, warning them at the same time
against thistles and thorns. And I devise to children
the banks of the brooks, and the golden sands beneath
the waters thereof, and the odors of the willows
that dip therein, and the white clouds that float high
over the giant trees. And I leave the children the
long, long days to be merry in, in a thousand ways,
and the night and the moon and the train of the
milky way to wonder at.”</p>

<p>What thinks the teacher of such riches, what the
librarian with her catalogue number? A book is
a fact, nay, a friend, a dream. Is there not a creed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
for us all in the wisdom of that crazy man? Here
was one with clear vision, to whom fact was as nothing
before the essential of one’s nature—a prophet, a
seer, one to whom the tragedy of growing up had
been no tragedy, but whose memory of childhood
had produced a chastening effect upon his manhood.
Are we surprised to find him adding:</p>

<p>“I give to good fathers and mothers, in trust for
their children, all good little words of praise and encouragement,
and all quaint pet names and endearments,
and I charge said parents to use them justly
and generously, as the needs of their children may
require.”</p>

<p>And so, we ask, more especially the parent than
the librarian, is there not excitement in the very
drawing out from a child his heart’s desire? Imperative
it is in all cases that book-buying should not
be a lottery, but more persistently apparent does it
become that a child’s <em>one</em> individual book upon the
Christmas-tree or for a birthday should not represent
a grown-up’s after-thought.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p><i>I wish Mrs. Marcet, the Right Honourable T. B. Macaulay,
or any other person possessing universal knowledge,
would take a toy and child’s emporium in hand, and explain
to us all the geographical and historical wonders it contains.
That Noah’s ark, with its varied contents—its leopards
and lions, with glued pump-handled tails; its light-blue elephants
and</i> ꓕ <i>footed ducks—that ark containing the cylindrical
family of the patriarch—was fashioned in Holland,
most likely, by some kind pipe-smoking friends of youth by
the side of a slimy canal. A peasant in a Danubian pine-wood
carved that extraordinary nut-cracker, who was
painted up at Nuremberg afterwards in the costume of a
hideous hussar. That little fir lion, more like his roaring
original than the lion at Barnet, or the lion of Northumberland
House, was cut by a Swiss shepherd boy tending his
goats on a mountain-side, where the chamois were jumping
about in their untanned leather. I have seen a little Mahometan
on the Etmeidan at Constantinople twiddling about
just such a whirligig as you may behold any day in the
hands of a small Parisian in the Tuileries Gardens. And
as with the toys, so with the toy books. They exist everywhere:
there is no calculating the distance through which
the stories come to us, the number of languages through
which they have been filtered, or the centuries during which
they have been told. Many of them have been narrated,
almost in their present shape, for thousands of years
since, to little copper-coloured Sanscrit children, listening
to their mother under the palm-trees by the banks
of the yellow Jumna—their Brahmin mother, who softly
narrated them through the ring in her nose. The very
same tale has been heard by the Northmen Vikings as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
they lay on their shields on deck; and by Arabs couched
under the stars on the Syrian plains when the flocks were
gathered in and the mares were picketed by the tents. With
regard to the story of Cinderella, I have heard the late
Thomas Hill say that he remembered to have heard, two
years before Richard Cœur de Lion came back from Palestine,
a Norman jongleur—but, in a word, there is no end to the

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Horn-books; Chap-books; The New England Primer.</span></h3>

<p>Previous to the impetus given to child study
by the educational theories of Rousseau,
little was written intentionally for children that would
not at the same time appeal to adults. Yet there
are chapters still to be penned, stretching back into
English history as far as 1430 and earlier, when words
of instruction were framed for youth; when conduct,
formality, austere manners, complete submission, were
not only becoming to the child, but were forced upon
him.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>There are several manuscripts extant of that year,
1430, one whose authorship is ascribed to John
Lydgate and which bears the Latin title, “Puer ad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Mensam.” There is also the “Babees Book” of
1475, intended for those boys of royal blood who
served as pages in the palace. The American student
has to reach an understanding of the purport
of most of these treatises from secondary sources;
the manuscripts are not easily accessible, and have
so far been utilised only in a fragmentary character.
For the present purpose, the mention of a few examples
will suffice.</p>

<p>We note “A Booke in Englyssh metre, of the
great marchaunt man called Dyves Pragmaticus,
very pretye for chyldren to rede; wherby they may
the better, and more readyer rede and wryte Wares
and Implementes in this worlde contayned....
When thou sellest aught unto thy neighbour, or
byest anything of him, deceave not, nor oppresse
him, etc. Imprinted at London in Aldersgate strete
by Alexander Lacy, dwellyng beside the Wall.
The <span class="allsmcap">XXV.</span> of April 11, 1563.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Those boys bound out or apprenticed to members
of the Middle Age crafts and guilds perhaps benefited
by the moral of this; no doubt they bethought
themselves of the friendly warning, whenever they
cried their master’s wares outside the stalls; perhaps
they were forearmed as well as forewarned by the
friendly rules contained in the “Books of Good
Manners” (1560) which, though they could not own,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
were repeated to them by others more fortunate.
These same boys, who played the angels in the
miracle plays, and the Innocents in the “Rachel”
dramas, who were held suspended by a rope high
up in the nave of the church, to proclaim the birth
of the Lord in the Christmas cycles, were actors also,
around 1563, in “A New Enterlude for Chyldren to
Play, named Jacke Jugeler, both wytte, and very
playsent.”</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the boys of the early centuries
must have been not unlike the boys of all ages,
although the customs of an age usually stunt whatever
is not in conformity with the times. He who,
in 1572, was warned in “Youth’s Behaviour” (“or,
Decency in Conversation Amongst Men, Composed
in French by Grave Persons, for the use and benefit
of their youth, now newly turned into English, by
Francis Hawkins, nephew to Sir Thomas Hawkins.
The tenth impression.”), was likewise warned in
the New-England township, and needs to be warned
to-day. No necessity to paint the picture in more
definite colours than those emanating from the mandates
direct. “Hearing thy Master, or likewise the
Preacher, wriggle not thyself, as seeming unable to
contain thyself within thy skin.” Uncomfortable
in frills or stiff collars, and given no backs to benches,
the child was doomed to a dreary sermon full of
brimstone and fire; he was expected, “in yawning,
[to] howl not.” The translation, it will be remarked,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
was made by Master Francis when he had scarce
attained the age of eight; this may be considered precocious,
but, when French was more the official
language than English, it was necessary that all
persons of any distinction should have a mastery of
the polite tongue, even though they might remain
not so well equipped in the language of learning.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Hawkins was therefore carefully exercised and the
translation became a task in a twofold way. His
uncle soon followed the first section of “Youth’s
Behaviour” with a second part, intended for girls.</p>

<p>Poor starved souls of those young gentlewomen of
the sixteenth century, who were recommended, for
their entertainment in hours of recreation, to read
“God’s Revenge against Murther; and the Arcadia
of Sir Philip Sydney; Artemidorus, his Interpretation
of Dreams. And for the business of their
devotion, there is an excellent book entitled Taylor’s
Holy Living and Dying; The Duty of Man in which
the Duty to God and man are both comprehended.”
Such guidance is not peculiar alone to this period.
It was followed, in slightly simplified form, throughout
the didactic school of writing.</p>

<p>Fortunately we are able, by means of our historical
imagination, to fill up the interstices of this
grave assemblage with something of a more entertaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
character; we have a right to include the folk
tales, the local legends and hero deeds which have
descended to us through countless telling. Romance
and interest still lie buried in annals which might
be gathered together, dealing with the lives of those
nurses who reared ancient kings. As a factor in
the early period of children’s literature, the grandam
is of vast meaning.</p>

<p>About the time of which we have just been speaking,
as early as 1570, little folks began learning their
letters from horn-books and “battle-dores.” Take
an abacus frame and transfer the handle to one of
its sides as a base. Within the frame insert a single
leaf of thick cardboard, on one side of which place
the alphabet, large and small, lettered heavily in
black. Then, with the regularity of a regiment,
string out three or four slender columns of monosyllables.
Do we not here detect the faint glimmer
of our college song, “b-a, ba; b-e, be; b-i,
bi; babebi”? Should one side not hold all this, use
both, although it is not preferable to do so. However,
it <em>is</em> essential that ample room be left in any
case for the inclusion of the Lord’s Prayer. When
this is done, slip over the face of the cardboard a
clear piece of diaphanous horn, in default of which
isinglass will suffice. Through the handle bore a
hole, into which run a string. Finally, attach your
handiwork to a girdle or belt, and behold, you are
transformed into a school child of the Middle Ages!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
Your abacus has become a horn-book, quite as
much by reason of its horn surface, as because of
its essential use. Should you be looking for historical
accuracy, let the “Christ-cross” precede the
alphabet, whence it will become apparent why our
letters are often styled the Criss-cross row. Flourishing
until some time during the reign of George
II, these curiosities are now rare indeed. There is
little of an attractive nature in such a “lesson-book,”
but childhood had its compensations, for there is
preserved the cheerful news that horn-books were
often made of gingerbread. Were these the forebears
of our animal crackers or our spiced alphabets?</p>

<p>A survey of chap-books<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> presents a picture of
literature trying to be popular; we find all classes
of people being catered to, young and old, rich and
poor. The multitude of assorted pamphlets reflects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
the manners, the superstitions, the popular
customs of rustics; the stories stretch from the
humourous to the strictly religious type. There are
many examples preserved, for not until well on in
the nineteenth century were chap-books supplanted
in favour. To-day, the largest collection that the
world possesses, garnered by Professor Child, is to
be found in the Harvard University Library; but
the Bodleian and the British Museum claim to be
richer in early examples, extending back to 1598.</p>

<p>Charles Gerring, calling the chap-books “uninviting,
poor, starved things,” yet lays before readers
not an unwholesome array of goods. He writes:</p>

<p>“For the lads, there were tales of action, of adventure,
sometimes truculently sensational; for the
girls were stories of a more domestic character;
for the tradesmen, there was the ‘King and the
Cobbler,’ or ‘Long Tom the Carrier’; for the soldier
and the sailor, ‘Admiral Blake,’ ‘Johnny Armstrong,’
and ‘Chevy Chase’; for the lovers, ‘Patient Grissil’
and ‘Delights for Young Men and Maids’; for the
serving-lad, ‘Tom Hickathrift’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and ‘Sir Richard
Whittington’; while the serving-maid then, as now,
would prefer ‘The Egyptian Fortune Teller,’ or
‘The Interpretation of Dreams and Moles.’”</p>

<p>Every phase of human nature was thus served up
for a penny. In those days, people were more apt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
to want tales with heroes and heroines of their own
rank and station; a certain appropriateness in this
way was satisfied. Such correspondence was common
as early as 1415, when a mystery play was
presented by the crafts, and the Plasterers were
given the “Creation of the World” to depict, while
the Chandlers were assigned the “Lighting of the
Star” upon the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>There were to be had primers, song-books, and
joke-books; histories, stories, and hero tales.
Printed in type to ruin eyes, pictured in wood-cuts
to startle fancy and to shock taste—for they were not
always suited to childhood—these pamphlets, 2½″ ×
3½″, sometimes 5½″ × 4¼″ in size, and composed of
from four to twenty-four pages, served a useful
purpose. They placed literature within reach of
all who could read. Queer dreams, piety of a pronounced
nature, jests with a ribald meaning, and
riddles comprised the content of many of them. A
child who could not buy a horn-book turned to the
“battle-dore” with his penny—a crude sheet of
cardboard, bicoloured and folded either once or
twice, with printing on both sides; the reading matter
was never-failingly the same in these horn-books
and “battle-dores,” although sometimes the wood-cuts
varied. A horn-book is recorded with a picture
of Charles I upon it.</p>

<p>The sixteenth or seventeenth-century boy could own
his “Jack and the Giants” and “Guy of Warwick,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
his “Hector of Troy” and “Hercules of Greece”;
he could even have the latest imported novelty.
Some believe that because Shakespeare based many
of his plays upon Continental legends, a demand
was started for such chap-books as “Fortunatus,”
“Titus Andronicus,” or “Valentine and Orson.”
The printers of these crude booklets were on the
alert for every form of writing having a popular
appeal; there was rivalry among them as there is
rivalry among publishers to-day. Not long after
the appearance of the English translation of Perrault’s
“Tales of Mother Goose,” each one of them,
given a separate and attractive form—“Blue-beard”
in awful ferocity, “Cinderella” in gorgeous apparel,
and the others—was made into a chap-book. In
Ashton, we find mention of an early catalogue “of
Maps, Prints, Copy-books, Drawing-books, Histories,
Old Ballads, Patters, Collections, etc., printed
and sold by Cluer Dicey and Richard Marshall at
the Printing-Office in Aldermary (4) Church Yard,
London. Printed in the year MDCCLXIV.”
These men appear to have been important chap-book
publishers.</p>

<p>The hawkers, who went through the streets and
who travelled the country-side, much as our pioneer
traders were accustomed to do, were termed chapmen.
They were eloquent in the manner of describing
their display; they were zealous as to their line of
trade. Imagine, if you will, the scene in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
isolated village—the wild excitement when the good
man arrived. He was known to Piers Plowman
in 1362, he perhaps wandered not far away from
the Canterbury Pilgrims; each of Chaucer’s Tales
might well be fashioned as a chap-book. Along
the dusty highway this old-time peddler travelled,
with packet on his back and a stout staff in hand—such
a character maybe as Dougal Grahame, hunch-backed
and cross-eyed—by professions, a town crier
and bellman, as well as a trader in literature. On
his tongue’s tip he carried the latest gossip; he
served as an instrument of cross-fertilisation, bringing
London-town in touch with Edinburgh or Glasgow,
and with small hamlets on the way.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to know, my lady,” he would ask,
“how fares the weather on the morrow?” From
the depths of his packet he would draw “The Shepherd’s
Prognostication” (1673), wherein is told that
“the blust’ring and noise of leaves and trees and
woods, or <cite>other places</cite> is a token of foul weather.”
“And prithee, mistress,” he would add, “I have a
warning herein for you. A mole on the forehead
denotes fair riches, but yonder brown spot on your
eyebrow bids me tell you to refrain from marriage,
for if he marry you, he shall have seven wives in his
life-time!”</p>

<p>Many a modern reader would be interested in the
detailed directions given for falling in love and for
falling out again; for determining whom fate had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
decreed as the husband, or who was to be the wife.
It is more wholesome in these days to name the four
corners of a bedroom than to submit to the charm
of a pared onion, wrapped in a kerchief and placed
on the pillow; yet the two methods must be
related.</p>

<p>For the little ones, there were picture-books in
bright colours, smug in their anachronisms. The
manufacturers of chap-books never hesitated to use
the same wood-cuts over and over again; Queen Anne
might figure in a history, but she served as well in the
capacity of Sleeping Beauty; more appropriate in
its historical application seems to have been the
appearance of Henry VIII as Jack the Giant-Killer.</p>

<p>The subject of chap-books is alluring; the few
elements here noted suggest how rich in local colour
the material is. Undoubtedly the roots of juvenile
literature are firmly twined about these penny
sheets. Their circulation is a matter that brings
the social student in touch with the middle-class life.
Not only the chap-books and the horn-books, but
the so-called Garlands, rudimentary anthologies of
popular poems and spirited ballads, served to relieve
the drudgery of commonplace lives, toned the sluggish
mind by quickening the imagination. A curious
part of the history of these Garlands is their
sudden disappearance, brought about by two types
of hawkers, known as the “Primers-up” and “Long-Song
Sellers,” who peddled a new kind of ware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>The Primers-up are relatives of our city venders.
They clung to corners, where dead walls gave them
opportunity to pin their literature within sight of
the public. Wherever there happened to be an
unoccupied house, one of these fellows would be
found with his songs, coarse, sentimental, and
spirited, cut in slips a yard long—three yards for a
penny. Thus displayed, he would next open a
gaudy umbrella, upon the under side of which an
art gallery of cheap prints was free to look upon.
Conjure up for yourselves the apprentice peering
beneath the large circumference of such a gingham
tent.</p>

<p>Across the way, the Long-Song Sellers marched
up and down, holding aloft stout poles, from
which streamed varied ribbons of verse—rhythm
fluttering in the breeze—and yelling, “Three
yards a penny, songs, beautiful songs, nooest
songs.”</p>

<p>It is apparent that much of the horn-book is incorporated
in the “New England Primer,” although
the development of the latter may be considered
independently. The Primer is an indispensable part
of Puritan history in America, despite the fact that
its source extends as far back as the time of Henry
VIII, when it was probably regarded more in the
light of a devotional than of an educational book.
The earliest mention of it in New England was that
published in the Boston <cite>Almanac</cite> of 1691, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Benjamin Harris, bookseller and printer, called
attention to its second impression.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Before that, in
1685, Samuel Green, a Boston printer, issued a
primer which he called “The Protestant Teacher
for Children,” and a copy of which may be seen in
the library of the American Antiquarian Society
of Worcester, Massachusetts. The title would indicate
also that in America the primer for children at
first served the same purpose as the morality play
for adults in England; it was a vehicle for religious
instruction.</p>

<p>The oldest existent copy of the New England
Primer bears the imprint of Thomas Fleet, son-in-law
of the famous Mrs. Goose, of whom we shall
speak later. This was in 1737. Before then, in
1708, Benjamin Eliot of Boston, probably encouraged
by earlier editions of primers, advertised “The First
Book for Children; or, The Compleat School-Mistress”;
and Timothy Green in 1715 announced
“A Primer for the Colony of Connecticut; or, an
Introduction to the True Reading of English. To
which is added Milk for Babes.” This latter title
suggests the name of the Reverend John Cotton,
and, furthermore, the name of Cotton Mather, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
of the austere writers, as the titles of his books alone
bear witness.</p>

<p>Six copies of the New England Primer lay before
me, brown paper covers, dry with age; blue boards,
worn with much handling; others in gray and green
that have faded like the age which gave them birth.
The boy who brought them to me wore a broad
smile upon his face; perhaps he was wondering why
I wished such toy books, no larger than 3¼″ × 2½″.
He held them all in one hand so as to show his superior
strength. Yet had he been taken into the dark
corridor between the book stacks, and had he been
shown the contents of those crinkly leaves, there
might have crept over him some remnant of the
feeling of awe which must have seized the Colonial
boy and girl. What would he have thought of the
dutiful child’s promises, or of the moral precepts, had
they been read to him? Would he have shrunk
backward at the description of the bad boy?
Would he have beamed with youthful hope of salvation
upon the picture of the good boy? It is doubtful
whether the naughty girls, called “hussies,” ever
reformed; it is doubtful whether they ever wanted
to be the good girl of the verses. That smiling boy
of the present would have turned grave over the cut
of Mr. John Rogers in the flames, despite the placid
expression of wonderful patience over the martyr’s
face; his knees would have trembled at the sombre
meaning of the lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I in the burial place may see</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Graves shorter far than I;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From death’s arrest no age is free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Young children too may die.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The New England Primers<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> were called pleasant
guides; they taught that the longest life is a lingering
death. There was the fear instead of the love of
God in the text, and yet the type of manhood fostered
by such teaching was no wavering type, no half-way
spirit. The Puritan travelled the narrow road, but
he faced it, however dark the consequences.</p>

<p>Sufficient has been said to give some idea of the
part occupied by these early publications—whether
horn-book, chap-book, or primer. They bore an
intimate relation to the life of the child; they were,
together with the Almanack, which is typified by
that of “Poor Richard,” and with the Calendar,
part of a development which may be traced, with
equal profit, in England, Scotland, France, and
Germany. Their full history is fraught with human
significance.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">La Fontaine and Perrault.</span></h3>

<p>Folk-lore stretches into the Valhalla of the past;
our heritage consists of an assemblage of the heroic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
through all ages. A history of distinctive books for
children must enter into minute traceries of the
golden thread of legend, fable, and belief, of romance
and adventure; it must tell of the wanderings of
rhyme and marvel, under varied disguises, from
mouth to mouth, from country to country, naught
of richness being taken away from them, much of
new glory being added. But for our immediate
purposes, we imagine all this to be so; we take it
for granted that courtier and peasant have had their
fancies. The tales told to warriors are told to
children, and in turn by nurses to these children’s
children. The knight makes his story by his own
action in the dark forest, or in the king’s palace;
he appears before the hut of the serf, and his horse is
encircled by a magic light. The immortal hero is
kept immortal by what is heroic in ourselves.</p>

<p>Jean de La Fontaine (1621–1695) was a product
of court life; and the fable was the literary form
introduced to amuse the corsaged ladies of Versailles.
La Fontaine was the cynic in an age of hypocrisy and
favouritism, and one cannot estimate his work fully,
apart from the social conditions fostering it. He
was steeped in French lore, and in a knowledge
of the popular tales of the Middle Ages. He was
licentious in some of his writing, and wild in his
living; he was a friend of Fouquet, and he knew
Molière, Racine, and Boileau. He was a brilliant,
unpractical satirist, who had to be supported by his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
friends, and who was elected to the Academy because
his monarch announced publicly that he had
promised to behave. Toward the end of his life he
atoned for his misdemeanours by a formal confession.</p>

<p>There was much of the child heart in La Fontaine,
and this characteristic, together with the spleen
which develops in every courtier, aided him in his
composition of the Fables. Unclean his tales may
be, likened to Boccaccio, but the true poet in him
produced incomparable verses which have been saved
for the present and will live far into the future because
of the universality of their moral. The wolf
and dog, the grasshopper and ant, all moved in silks
and satins at the court of Louis XIV, and bowed
for social rank, some trailing their pride in the dust,
others raised to high position through the fortune of
unworthy favour. So successfully did La Fontaine
paint his pictures that the veiled allusions became
lost in time beneath the distinct individuality of
the courtiers’ animal prototypes. The universal in
La Fontaine is like the universal in Molière and
Shakespeare, but it has a wider appeal, for children
relish it as their own.</p>

<p>Another figure was dominant at the court of
Louis XIV—one equally as immortal as La Fontaine,
though not so generally known—Charles Perrault
(1628–1703). He was a brilliant genius, versatile in
talent and genial in temper. He dabbled in law, he
dabbled in architecture, and through it won the favour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of Colbert. With an abiding love for children, he
suggested and successfully carried the idea of keeping
open the royal gardens for young Parisians.
Through Colbert he became an Academician in
1671, and, with the energy which usually marked his
actions, he set about influencing the rulings of that
body. He was a man of progress, not an advocate
of classical formalism. He battled long and hard
with Boileau, who was foremost among the Classicists;
his appeal was for the future rather than for
the past. He was intellectually alert in all matters;
probably, knowing that he possessed considerable
hold upon the Academy, he purposely startled that
august gathering by his statement that had Homer
lived in the days of Louis XIV he would have made
a better poet. But the declaration was like a burning
torch set to dry wood; Boileau blazed forth, and
the fight between himself and Perrault, lasting some
time, became one of the most famous literary quarrels
that mark the pages of history.</p>

<p>After Perrault retired to his home in the year 1686,
and when he could have his children around him,
he began the work which was destined to last.
Lang calls him “a good man, a good father, a good
Christian, and a good fellow.” It is in the capacity
of father that we like to view him—taking an interest
in the education of his children, listening to them
tell their tales which they had first heard from their
nurse; his heart became warmed by their frank, free
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
<i lang='fr'>camaraderie</i>, and it is likely that these impromptu
story hours awakened in him some dim memories of
the same legends told him in his boyhood.</p>

<p>There is interesting speculation associated with
his writing of the “Contes de ma Mère l’Oye.”
They were published in 1697, although previously
they had appeared singly in Moetjen’s Magazine at
the Hague. An early letter from Madame de
Sévigné mentions the wide-spread delight taken by
the nobles of the court in all “contes”; this was
some twenty years before Perrault penned his.
But despite their popularity among the worldly wise,
the Academician was too much of an Academician
to confess openly that he was the author of the
“contes.” Instead, he ascribed them to his son,
Perrault Darmancour. This has raised considerable
doubt among scholars as to whether the boy
should really be held responsible for the authorship
of the book. Mr. Lang wisely infers that there is
much evidence throughout the tales of the mature
feeling and art of Perrault; but he also is content
to hold to the theory that will blend the effort of old
age and youth, of father and son.</p>

<p>The fact remains that, were it not for Perrault,
the world might have been less rich by such immortal
pieces as “The Three Wishes,” “The Sleeping
Beauty,” “Red Riding Hood,” “Blue Beard,”
“Puss in Boots,” and “Cinderella,” as they are
known to us to-day. They might have reached us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
from other countries in modified form, but the inimitable
pattern belongs to Perrault.</p>

<p>Another monument preserves his name, the discussion
of which requires a section by itself. But
consideration must be paid in passing to the “fées” of
Marie Catherine Jumelle de Berneville, Comtesse
D’Anois (Aulnoy) [1650 or 51–1705], who is responsible
for such tales as “Finetta, the Cinder-Girl.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Fortunately, to the charm of her fairy stories, which
are written in no mean imitation of Perrault, there
have clung none of the qualities which made her one
of the most intriguing women of her period. She
herself possessed a magnetic personality and a
bright wit. Her married life began at the age of
sixteen, and through her career lovers flocked to her
standard; because of the ardour of one, she came
near losing her head. But despite the fact that only
two out of five of her children could claim legitimacy,
they seem to have developed in the Comtesse d’Aulnoy
an unmistakable maternal instinct, and an
unerring judgment in the narration of stories. She
is familiar to-day because of her tales, although
recently an attractive edition of her “Spanish Impressions”
was issued—a book which once received
the warm commendation of Taine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Mother Goose.</span></h3>

<p>There has been a sentimental desire on the part
of many students to trace the origin of Mother Goose
to this country; but despite all effort to the contrary,
and a false identification of Thomas Fleet’s mother-in-law,
Mrs. Goose, or Vergoose, with the famous
old woman, the origin is indubitably French.
William H. Whitmore<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> sums up his evidence in
the matter as follows:</p>

<p>“According to my present knowledge, I feel
sure that the original name is merely a translation
from the French; that the collection was first made
for and by John Newbery of London, about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1760; and that the great popularity of the book is
due to the Boston editions of Munroe and Francis,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1824–1860.”</p>

<p>It appears that, in 1870, William A. Wheeler
edited an edition of “Mother Goose,” wherein he
averred that Elizabeth, widow of one Isaac Vergoose,
was the sole originator of the jingles. This
statement was based upon the assurances of a descendant,
John Fleet Eliot. But there is much
stronger evidence in Perrault’s favour than mere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
hearsay; even the statement that a 1719 volume of
the melodies was printed by Fleet himself has so
far failed of <span id='cor_41'>verification.</span></p>

<p>The name, Mother Goose, is first heard of in the
seventeenth century. During 1697, Perrault published
his “Histoires ou Contes du Tems Passé
avec des Moralitez,” with a frontispiece of an old
woman telling stories to an interested group. Upon
a placard by her side was lettered the significant
title already quoted:</p>

<p class='center b0 p1'>CONTES</p>
<p class='center p0 b0'>DE MA</p>
<p class='center p0 b0'>MERE</p>
<p class='center p0'>LOYE</p>

<p class='p1'>There is no doubt, therefore, that the name was not
of Boston origin; some would even go further back
and mingle French legend with history; they would
claim that the mother of Charlemagne, with the
title of Queen Goose-foot (Reine Pédance), was
the only true source.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Austin Dobson has called Mr. Lang’s attention
to the fact that in the <cite>Monthly Chronicle</cite> for March,
1729, an English version of Perrault’s “Tales” was
mentioned, done by Mr. Robert Samber, and printed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
by J. Pote; another English edition appeared at
The Hague in 1745. This seems to be the first
introduction into England of the “Mother Goose
Fairy Tales.” It was probably their popularity,
due not only to their intrinsic interest, but partly
to the speculation as to Mother Goose’s identification,
that made John Newbery, the famous London publisher,
conceive the brilliant plan of gathering together
those little songs familiar to the nursery,
and of laying them to the credit of Mother Goose
herself. In so doing, he solicited the assistance
of Oliver Goldsmith (1728–1774). Mr. Whitmore
writes:</p>

<p>“If, as seems most probable, the first edition of
‘Mother Goose’s Melody’ was issued prior to John
Newbery’s death in 1767, there is an interesting
question as to who prepared the collection for the
press. The rhymes are avowedly the favourites of
the nursery, but the preface and the foot-notes are
an evident burlesque upon more pretentious works.”</p>

<p>There are two small pieces of evidence indicating
clearly Goldsmith’s editorship. On January 29,
1768, he produced his “Good Natur’d Man,” and
with his friends dined beforehand in gala fashion at
an inn. Subject to extremes of humour, on this
occasion he was most noisy, and he sang his favourite
song, we are told, which was nothing more than “An
old woman tossed in a blanket, seventeen times as
high as the moon.” As it happens, this ditty is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
mentioned in the preface to Newbery’s collection of
rhymes, without any more apparent reason than that
it was a favourite with the editor, who wished to
introduce it in some way, however irrelevant. Again,
we are assured that Miss Hawkins once exclaimed,
“I little thought what I should have to boast, when
Goldsmith taught me to play Jack and Jill, by two
bits of paper on his fingers.”</p>

<p>Thus, though the tasks performed by Goldsmith
for Newbery are generally accounted specimens
of hack work, which he had to do in order to eke out
a livelihood, there is satisfaction in claiming for him
two immortal strokes, his tale of “Goody Two
Shoes,” and his share in the establishment of the
Mother Goose Melodies.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Many a time he was
dependent upon the beneficence of his publisher,
many a time rescued by him from the hands of the
bailiff. The Newbery accounts are dotted with
entries of various loans; even the proceeds of the
first performances of the “Good Natur’d Man” were
handed over to Newbery to satisfy one of his claims.</p>

<p>The notes accompanying the melodies, and which
have no bearing upon the child-interest in the collection,
show a wit that might very well belong to Goldsmith.
He was perhaps amusing himself at the
expense of his lexicographer friend, Johnson. For
instance, to the jingle, “See saw, Margery Daw,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
is appended this, taken seemingly from “Grotius”:
“It is a mean and scandalous Practice in Authors to
put Notes to Things that deserve no Notice.” And
to the edifying and logical song, “I wou’d, if I cou’d,
If I cou’dn’t, how cou’d I? I cou’dn’t, without I
cou’d, cou’d I?” is attached the evident explanation
from “Sanderson”: “This is a new Way of handling
an old Argument, said to be invented by a famous
Senator; but it has something in it of <em>Gothick</em> Construction.”
Assuredly the names of those learned
authors, “Mope,” credited with the “Geography of
the Mind,” and “Huggleford,” writing on “Hunger,”
were intended for ridicule.</p>

<p>By 1777, “Mother Goose” had passed into its
seventh edition, but, though its success was largely
assured, there are still to be noted rival publications.
For instance, John Marshall,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> who later became the
publisher of Mrs. Trimmer’s works, issued some
rhymes, conflicting with the book of Melodies which
Carnan, Newbery’s stepson, had copyrighted in 1780,
and had graced with a subtitle, “Sonnets for the
Cradle.” During 1842, J. O. Halliwell edited for
the Percy Society, “The Nursery Rhymes of England,
collected principally from Oral Tradition,” and
he mentioned an octavo volume printed in London,
1797, and containing some of our well-known verses.
These it seems had been first collected by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
scholar, Joseph Ritson,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and called “Gammer
Gurton’s Garland.” The 1797 book was called
“Infant Institutes,” semi-satirical in its general
plan, and was ascribed to the Reverend Baptist
Noel Turner, M.A.,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> rector of Denton. If this was
intended to supplant Newbery’s collection, it failed
in its object. However, it is to be noted and emphasised
that so varied did the editions become, that
the fate of “Mother Goose” would not have been at
all fortunate in the end, had not Monroe and Francis
in Boston insisted upon the original collection as
the authentic version, <i lang='la'>circa</i> 1824. Its rights were
thus established in America.</p>

<p>The melodies have a circuitous literary history.
In roundabout fashion, the ditties have come out of
the obscure past and have been fixed at various
times by editors of zealous nature. For the folk-lore
student, such investigation has its fascination; but
the original rhymes are not all pure food for the
nursery. In the course of time, the juvenile volumes
have lost the jingles with a tang of common wit.
They come to us now, gay with coloured print, rippling
with merriment, with a rhythm that must be kept
time to by a tap of the foot upon the floor or by some
bodily motion. Claim for them, as you will, an educational
value; they are the child’s first entrance
into storyland; they train his ear, they awaken his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
mind, they develop his sense of play. It is a joyous
garden of incongruity we are bequeathed in “Mother
Goose.”</p>


<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">John Newbery, Oliver Goldsmith, and Isaiah Thomas.</span></h3>

<p>Wherever you wander in the land of children’s
books, ramifications, with the vein of hidden gold,
invite investigation,—rich gold for the student and
for the critic, but less so for the general reader.
Yet upon the general reader a book’s immortality
depends. No librarian, no historian, need be crowded
out; there are points still to be settled, not in the
mere dry discussion of dates, but in the estimates of
individual effect. The development of children’s
books is consecutive, carried forward because of
social reasons; each name mentioned has a story of
its own. Two publishers at the outset attract our
regard; except for them, much would have been
lost to English and American children.</p>

<p>As early as Elizabeth’s time, Rafe Newberie,
Master of Stationer’s Company, published Hakluyt’s
“Voyages.” From him, John Newbery (1713–1767)
was descended. Given an ordinary schooling,
he was apprenticed to the printer, William Carnan,
who, dying in 1737, divided his worldly goods between
his brother Charles, and his assistant John. The
latter, in order to cement his claim still further,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
married his employer’s widow, by whom he had
three children, Francis, his successor in the publishing
business, being born on July 6, 1743.</p>

<p>Newbery was endowed with much common sense.
He travelled somewhat extensively before settling
in London, and, during his wanderings, he jotted
down rough notes, relating especially to his future
book trade; the remarks are worthy of a keen critic.
During this time it is hard to keep Newbery, the publisher,
quite free from the picturesque career of Newbery,
the druggist; on the one hand Goldsmith
might call him “the philanthropic publisher of St.
Paul’s Churchyard,” as he did in the “Vicar of
Wakefield,” which was first printed by Newbery
and Benjamin Collins, of Salisbury; on the other
hand, in 1743, one might just as well have praised
him for the efficacy of the pills and powders he
bartered. Now we find him a shopkeeper, catering
to the captains of ships from his warehouse, and
adding every new concoction to his stock of homeopathic
deceptions. Even Goldsmith could not refrain
from having a slap at his friend in “Quacks
Ridiculed.”</p>

<p>He made money, however, and he associated with
a literary set among whom gold was much coveted
and universally scarce. The portly Dr. Johnson
ofttimes borrowed a much-needed guinea, an unfortunate
privilege, for he had a habit of never working
so long as he could feel money in his pocket. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
generosity on the part of Newbery did not deter
Johnson from showing his disapproval over many
of the former’s publications. We can well imagine
the implied sarcasm in his declaration that Newbery
was an extraordinary man, “for I know not whether
he has read, or written most books.” Between 1744
and 1802, records indicate that Newbery and his
successors printed some three hundred volumes, two
hundred of which were juvenile; small wonder he
needed the editorial assistance of such persons as
Dr. Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p>One of the first pieces the latter let Newbery have,
was an article for the <cite>Literary Magazine</cite> of January,
1758. Then there came into existence <cite>The Universal
Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette</cite> in April, 1758,
for which Johnson wrote “The Idler.” In 1759,
<cite>The British Magazine or Monthly Repository for
Gentlemen and Ladies, by T. Smollett, M.D., and
others</cite> was announced, Smollett then taking a rest
cure in jail. As though magazines could be launched
in a few hours without sinking, a daily sheet called
the <cite>Public Ledger</cite> was brought into existence on
January 12, 1760, for which Goldsmith wrote his
“Chinese Letters.” Between this date and 1767,
Goldsmith resided in a room on the upper floor of
Newbery’s house at Islington, and the publisher’s
son declares that while there Goldsmith read to him
odd parts of “The Traveller” and the “Vicar of
Wakefield.” This has not so much evidence to support
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
it as the fact that bills presented at the front
door for Goldsmith, usually found their way to Newbery
for settlement.</p>

<p>How much actual suggestion Goldsmith gave to
his publisher-employer, how far he influenced the
character of the books to be printed, cannot be
determined; he and Griffith and Giles Jones assuredly
encouraged the juvenile picture stories. An
advertisement of 1765 calls attention to the following:
“The Renowned History of Giles Gingerbread, a
little boy who lived upon learning” [the combination
is very appropriate in its compensating qualities of
knowledge and “sweets”]; “The Whitsuntide Gift,
or the Way to be Happy”; “The Valentine Gift, or
how to behave with honour, integrity and humanity”;
and “The History of Little Goody Two Shoes,
otherwise called Margery Two Shoes.”</p>

<p>Though he could not wholly escape the charge of
catering to the moral craze of the time, Newbery at
least infused into his little books something of imagination
and something of heroic adventure; not
sufficient however to please Dr. Johnson, who once
said: “Babies do not want to hear about babies;
they like to be told of giants and castles, and of
somewhat which can stretch and stimulate their little
minds.” A thrust at the ignorance of grown people,
regarding what children like, is further seen in Johnson’s
remark that parents buy, but girls and boys
seldom read what is calculated for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>There are many to praise Newbery’s prints; they
were more or less oddities, even in their own time.
Their usefulness was typified in such books as the
“Circle of Sciences,” a compendium of universal
knowledge; their attractiveness was dependent not
only upon the beauty of their make, but also upon
the queerness of their <i lang='fr'>format</i>; for example, such
volumes as were called the snuff-box series, or ready
references for waistcoat pockets. Then there was
the combination plan, indicated in the announcement:
“A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, intended for the
Instruction and Amusement of Little Master Tommy
and Pretty Miss Polly, with an agreeable letter to
read from Jack-the-Giant-Killer, as also a Ball and
Pincushion, the use of which will infallibly make
Tommy a Good Boy, and Polly a Good Girl....
Price of the Book alone, 6d., with a Ball or Pincushion,
8d.”</p>

<p>The variety of Newbery’s ideas resulted in every
species of book-publishing, from a children’s magazine
(<cite>The Lilliputian</cite>), with Goldsmith as the reputed
editor, to a child’s grammar. Interested one moment
in a machine for the colouring of silks and cloths,
at another he would be extolling the fever powders
of Dr. James, a whilom schoolfellow of Johnson.
He was untiring in his business activity. His firm
changed name many times, but always Newbery
remained the dominant figure. After his death,
the business continued for some while to be identified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
with its founder, and for a long period his original
policy was continued. Francis Newbery, the son,
left an autobiography of historic value.</p>

<p>Newbery’s real genius consisted in his trading
ability. Modern advertising is not more clever than
that practised by this shrewd man of the eighteenth
century. Not only was he in the habit of soliciting
puffs, and of making some of the characters in his
stories proclaim the excellencies of his books, but
the personal note and the friendly feeling displayed
in his newspaper items were uncommonly intimate.
Witness the London <cite>Chronicle</cite> for December 19–January
1, 1765:</p>

<p>“The Philosophers, Politicians, Necromancers,
and the learned in every faculty are desired to observe
that on the first of January, being New Year’s
day (oh, that we all may lead new lives!), Mr. Newbery
intends to publish the following important
volumes, bound and gilt, and hereby invites all his
little friends who are good to call for them at the
Bible and Sun, in St. Paul’s Churchyard, but those
who are naughty to have none.”</p>

<p>Thomas in later years adopted the same method
of advertising.</p>

<p>The most thorough piece of research work done
by Mr. Charles Welsh is his “A Bookseller of the
Last Century.” Had he aimed at nothing more
than preserving the catalogue of Newbery’s books,
he would have rendered a great service to the library
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
student. But he has in addition written a very
complete life of Newbery. When it is noted that
this printer was brought into business relations with
Robert Raikes, and was further connected with him
by the union of Newbery’s son with Raikes’ sister,
it is safe to believe that some of the piousness which
crept into the publisher’s wares was encouraged by
the zealous spirit of the founder of Sunday-schools.
Raikes will be dealt with in his proper place.</p>

<p>Newbery was what may be termed an enthusiastic
publisher, a careful manufacturer of books of the
flower-and-gilt species. As a friend he has been
pictured nothing loath to help the needy, but always
with generous security and heavy interest attached;
he was a business man above all else, and that betokens
keenness for a bargain, a keenness akin to
cleverness rather than to graciousness. In his
“Life of Goldsmith,” Washington Irving is inclined
to be severe in his estimate; he writes:</p>

<p>“The poet [Goldsmith] has celebrated him as
the friend of all mankind; he certainly lost nothing
by his friendship. He coined the brains of authors
in the times of their exigency, and made them pay
dear for the plank put out to keep them from drowning.
It is not likely his death caused much lamentation
among the scribbling tribe.”</p>

<p>One difficulty Newbery had to contend with was
the piracy of his books; there was no adequate
protection afforded by the copyright system, and we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
read of Goldsmith and Johnson bewailing the literary
thievery of the day. By some it was regarded as a
custom to be accepted; by others as a deplorable
condition beyond control. Early American authorship
suffered from the same evil, and Irving and
Cooper were the two prominent victims.</p>

<p>The book list of Isaiah Thomas (1749–1831), the
Worcester, Massachusetts printer, shows how
freely he drew from the London bookseller. Called
by many the Didot of America, founder of the American
Antiquarian Society, author of one of the most
authentic histories of early printing in this country,
he is the pioneer of children’s books for America.
He scattered his presses and stores over a region
embracing Worcester and Boston, Mass.; Concord,
N. H.; Baltimore, Md.; and Albany, N. Y. Books
were kept by him, so he vouched, specially for the
instruction and amusement of children, to make them
safe and happy. In his “Memoirs” there is found
abundant material to satisfy one as to the nature of
reading for young folks in New England, previous
to the Revolution.</p>

<p>Emerson writes in his “Spiritual Laws” regarding
“theological problems”; he calls them “the soul’s
mumps and measles and whooping-cough.” Already
the sombre sternness of Colonial literature
for children has been typified in the “New England
Primer.” The benefits of divine songs and
praises; the reiteration of the joy to parents, consequent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
upon the behaviour of godly children; the
mandates, the terrible finger of retribution, the warning
to all sinners lurking in the throat disease which
was prevalent at one time—all these ogres rise up
in the Thomas book to crush juvenile exuberance.
Does it take much description to get at the miserable
heart of the early piety displayed by the heroines of
Cotton Mather’s volumes, those stone images of
unthinkable children who passed away early, who
were reclaimed from disobedience, “children in
whom the fear of God was remarkably budding
before they died”? Writers never fail to say, in
speaking of Thomas White’s “Little Book for Children”
(reprint of 1702), that its immortality, in the
face of all its theology, is centred in one famous
untheological line, “A was an archer who shot at a
frog.”</p>

<p>What Thomas did, when he began taking from
Newbery, was to change colloquial English terms
to fit new environment; the coach no longer belongs
to the Lord Mayor, but to the Governor instead.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The text is only slightly altered. We recognise the
same little boys who would become great masters;
the same ear-marks stigmatise the heroines of “The
Juvenile Biographer,” insufferable apostles of surname-meaning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Mistresses Allgood, Careful, and
Lovebook, together with Mr. Badenough. Oh,
Betsey and Nancy and Amelia and Billy, did you
know what it was to romp and play?</p>

<p>The evident desire on the part of Miss Hewins, in
her discussion of early juvenile books, to emphasise
the playful, in her quotations from Thomas’ stories,
only indicates that there was little levity to deal with.
Those were the days of gilded “Gifts” and “Delights”;
the pleasures of childhood were strangely
considered; goodness was inculcated by making
the hair stand on end in fright, by picturing to the
naughty boy what animal he was soon to turn into,
and what foul beast’s disposition was akin to that
of the fractious girl. Intentions, both of an educational
and religious nature, were excellent, no doubt;
but, when all is estimated, the residue presents a
miserable, lifeless ash.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>So far no distinctive writer for children has arisen.
The volumes issued by Newbery represent a conscious
attempt to appeal through <em>form</em> to the juvenile
eye. If the books were addressed intentionally to
children, their amusement consisted in some extraneous
novelty; it was rarely contained in the
story. Action rather than motive is the redeeming
feature of “Goody Two Shoes.” As for religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
training, it was administered to the child with no
regard for his individual needs. He represented a
theological stage of sin; the world was a long dark
road, through the maze of which, by his birth, he
was doomed to fight his little way. Life was a
probationary period.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to leave the New England
book, and to return to it through another channel.
The viewpoint shifts slightly; a new element is to
be added: a self-conscious recognition of education
for children. The sternness of the “New England
Primer” possessed strength. The didactic school,
retaining the moral factor,—several points removed
from theology—sentimentalised it; for many a day
it was to exist in juvenile literature rampant. And,
overflowing its borders, it was to influence later
chap-books, and some of the later publications of
Thomas and Newbery. Through Hannah More,
it was to grip Peter Parley, and finally to die out on
American shores. For “Queechy” and “The Wide,
Wide World” represent the final flowering of this
style. In order to retain a clear connection, it is
necessary to watch both streams, educational and
moral, one at first blending with the other, and
flourishing in this country through a long list of
New England authors, until, in the end, the educational,
increasing in volume, conquered altogether.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Rousseau Impetus.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. E. V. Lucas has compiled two volumes
of old-fashioned tales for modern readers.
In his introductions he analyses the qualities of his
selected stories, and it is generally the case that,
except for incidental detail, what is said of one of a
kind might just as appropriately be meant for the
other. If, at moments, the editor is prone to confuse
quaintness with interest, he makes full amends by
the quick humour with which he deals with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
moral purpose. Perhaps it was part of the game
for our great-grandfathers to expect didacticism, but
simply because children were then considered “the
immature young of men” is no excuse, although
it may be a reason, for the artificiality which subserved
play to contemplation. Wherever he can
escape the bonds of primness, Mr. Lucas never fails
to take advantage; the character of his selections indicates
this as well as such critical remarks as the
following:</p>

<p>“The way toward a nice appreciation of the
child’s own peculiar characteristics was, however,
being sought by at least two writers of the eighteenth
century, each of whom was before his time: Henry
Brooke, who in ‘The Fool of Quality’ first drew a
small boy with a sense of fun, and William Blake,
who was the first to see how exquisitely worth study
a child’s mind may be.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas brings together a number of stories
by different persons, treating them as a group.
Should you read them you will have a fairly distinct
conception of early nineteenth century writing for
children. But there is yet another way of approaching
the subject, and that is by tracing influence from
writer to writer, from group to group; by seeking
for the <i lang='la'>impetus</i> without which the story becomes
even more of a husk than ever.</p>

<p>Let us conjure up the long row of theoretical children
of a bygone age, painfully pathetic in their staidness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
closely imprisoned. They began with Jean Jacques
Rousseau (1712–1778), the iconoclast, who attacked
civil society, the family, the state, the church, and
from whose pen the school did not escape chastisement.
His universal cry of “back to nature”
frightened the conservative; even Voltaire could not
refrain, on reading the essay dealing with the origin
of inequality among men, to write him: “Never
has any one employed so much genius to make us
into beasts. When one reads your book he is seized
at once with a desire to go down on all-fours.”</p>

<p>Rousseau’s “Émile, or Treatise on Education”
(1762) was wholly revolutionary; it tore down
ancient theories, such as those practised by Dr.
Isaac Watts upon his “ideal” boy and girl; all
existent educational strictures were ignored. Rousseau
applied to childhood his belief in the free unfolding
of man’s nature; however impracticable his
methods, he loosed the chains that held fast the
claims of childhood, and recognised their existence.
He set the pendulum swinging in the human direction;
he turned men’s minds upon the study of the
child as a child, and, because of this, takes his place
at the head of modern education. He opened the
way for a self-conscious striving on the part of
authors to meet the demands of a child’s nature, by
furnishing the best literary diet—according to educational
theories—for juvenile minds. Revolutionary
in religious as well as in political and social ideals,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Rousseau’s educational machinery was destined to
be infused, by some of his zealous followers, with a
piousness which he never would have sanctioned.</p>

<p>Training should be natural, says Rousseau; the
child should discover beauty, not be told about it;
should recognise spontaneously what he is now
taught. Education should be progressive; at the
same time it should be negative. This sounds contradictory,
but Rousseau would keep his child a
child until the age of twelve; he would prevent him
from knowing through any mental effort; he would
have him grow like “Topsy” in animal spirits, his
mind unbridled and imbibing facts as his lungs
breathe in air. Yet inconsistency is evident from
the outset: the child must observe, at the same time
he must not remember. Is it possible, as Professor
Payne challenges, to form the mind before furnishing
it?</p>

<p>Rousseau’s precepts are wise and brilliant. We
hear him exclaiming: “It is less consequence to
prevent him [the child] from dying than to teach him
how to live;” “The man who has lived most is not
he who has numbered the most years, but he who
has had the keenest sense of life;” “The best bed
is that which brings us the best sleep.” These
aphorisms are as apt as those of Franklin; but in
their exercise it is necessary to consider the concomitants
brought into play.</p>

<p>Émile is made an orphan; thus Rousseau gives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
himself full sway; thus does he free himself from
the necessity of constant consultation with parents.
He is determined to love the boy, to encourage him
in his sports, to develop his amiable instincts, his
natural self. Émile must not cry for the sweets of
life; he must have a need for all things rather than
a joyful desire for some. Instead of teaching virtue
to him, Rousseau will try to shield him from a
knowledge of all vice. Where Plato recommends
certain pastimes, he will train Émile to delight in
himself—thus making of him something of a youthful
egoist. This amœba state, endowed with all
physical liberty, deprived of all dignity of childish
memory, is to be the boyhood of Émile. He “shall
never learn anything by heart, not even fables and
not even those of La Fontaine, artless and charming
as they are.” Though he does not possess the
judgment to discriminate, he must be told the bare
facts, and he must discover for himself the relations
which these facts bear to each other. At the age
of twelve, he shall hardly know a book when he sees
it. Rousseau calls books “cheerless furniture.”</p>

<p>So much for the boy; the girl Sophie fares as ill.
Being of the woman kind as well as of the child
brand, she is to develop in even a more colourless
fashion. Fortunately all theory is not human actuality,
and Émile must have peopled his world in a
way Rousseau could not prevent. We are given
natural rights and hereditary endowments; even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the savage has his standards and his dreams. Rousseau’s
plan of existence ignored the social evolution of
history. Yet Émile might by such training have been
saved many wearisome explanations of the Mr. Barlow
type, and it is ofttimes true, as Mr. G. K. Chesterton
claims, that the mysteries of God are frequently
more understandable than the solutions of man.</p>

<p>There was much in Rousseau’s book to rouse
opposition; there was equally as much to appeal to
those whose instinctive love of childhood was simply
awaiting the flood gates to be opened. Like the
Grimm fairy tales of suspended animation, on the
instant, the paternal instinct began to be active,
the maternal instinct to be motherly. Rousseau—emended,
modified, accentuated—overran England,
France, and Germany. Children were now recognised
as children; it remained to be seen whether
they <em>were</em> to be children.</p>

<p>The didactic era is in no way more fitly introduced
than with the names of Madame de Genlis and
Arnaud Berquin in France, together with the Edgeworth
and Aikin families and Thomas Day in England.
To each, small space may be allotted, but
they are worthy of full and separate consideration.</p>

<p>Stéphanie Félicité [Ducrest de St. Aubin], Comtesse
de Genlis (1746–1830), is represented upon the
library shelves by nearly a hundred volumes. They
were written during the course of a varied existence,
at the court of Louis XV and at home. Her <cite>Mémoires</cite>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
are told in a facile and delightful style, and
indicate how she so thoroughly balanced the many
conflicting elements in her duties that she remains
for those days a rare example of wife, mother,
society woman, and student. Her discernment of
people, as revealed in these pages, was penetrating
and on the whole just; and, though a typical product
of her time, her nature was chastened by a refined
and noble spirit.</p>

<p>The first glimpse she affords of herself is as a
child of six, when she was taken to Paris. There,
her brother was placed at a seat of learning, where
the master guaranteed within six weeks’ time to
teach him reading and spelling by means of a system
of counters. The little girl’s teeth were shedding—not
a prepossessing phase of growth at best. But,
in addition, she was encased in whalebone stays,
her feet were squeezed into tight shoes, her curls
done up in corkscrew papers, and she was forced to
wear goggles. The height of cruelty now followed.
Country-bred as she had been, her manner was not
in accord with the best ideas; her awkwardness was
a matter of some concern. In order to give better
poise to her head, a thick iron collar was clapped
upon her supple throat. Here she was then, ready
for regular lessons in walking. To run was to court
disfavour, for little girls, especially city ones, were
not allowed to do such an improper thing; to leap
was an unspeakable crime; and to ask questions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
was an unwarranted license. It is small wonder
that later on she should utilise the memory of such
abject slavery in “The Dove,” one of the numerous
plays included in her “Theatre of Education.”</p>

<p>Her early years thus prepared Madame de Genlis
for the willing acceptance of any new educational
system, especially one which would advocate a constant
companionship between parents and child.
For she had been reared with but exceptional glimpses
of her father and mother; during one of these times
she relates how the former, in his desire to make
her brave, forced her to catch spiders in her hands.
Such a picture is worthy a place by the side of Little
Miss Muffet.</p>

<p>Like all children, Madame de Genlis was superior
to her limited pleasures; she possessed an imagination
which expanded and placed her in a heroic
world of her own making. There is peculiar pleasure
in discovering under narrow circumstances the good,
healthy spirit of youth. Madame de Genlis seemed
proud to record a certain dare-devil rebellion in
herself during this period. The pendulum that is
made to swing to its unnatural bent brings with the
downward stroke unexpected consequences. And
so, when she married De Genlis, it is no surprise
to read that she did so secretly—a union which is
most charmingly traced in the Memoirs.</p>

<p>She developed into a woman with deep religious
sensibility; with forceful personality; with artistic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
talent, well exemplified by a masterly execution on
the harp. Living in an atmosphere of court fêtes,
the drama occupied no small part in her daily life.
Whether at her Château Genlis or elsewhere, she
was ever ready for her rôle in theatricals, as dramatist
or as actress. She played in Molière, and was accounted
excellent in her characters; naught pleased
her better than a disguise; beneath it her vivacity
always disported itself.</p>

<p>Her interest in teaching began early; no sooner
was she a mother than she hastened to fix her
opinions as to the duties that lay before her, in a
written treatise called “Reflections of a Mother
Twenty Years of Age,” views which in their first
form were lost, but which were rehabilitated in the
later “Adèle et Théodore,” consisting of a series
of letters on education.</p>

<p>After her mind had been drawn to the style of
Buffon—for Madame de Genlis was a widely read
woman—she determined upon improving her own
manner of literary expression. She burned her
bridges behind her, and fed the flames with all of
her early manuscripts. Then she started over again
to reconstruct her views, and in her study she made
careful notes of what she fancied of importance for
her future use. She was on intimate terms with
Rousseau, took him to the theatre, and conversed
with him on education chiefly, and about diverse
matters generally. If she did not agree with him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Madame de Genlis was told that she had not as yet
reached the years of discretion when she would find
his writings suited to her. But Rousseau enjoyed
the vivacious lady, who was kind-hearted and worth
while talking to, notwithstanding the fact that she
had the courtier’s love of banter. She writes:</p>

<p>“Not to appear better than I am, I must admit
that I have often been given to ridicule others, but
I have never ridiculed anything but arrogance,
folly, and pedantry.”</p>

<p>Madame de Genlis was not a hero-worshipper;
on first meeting Rousseau, his coat, his maroon-coloured
stockings, his round wig suggested comedy
to her, rather than gravity. We wonder whether
she asked his advice regarding the use of pictures in
teaching history, a theory which she originated and
which Mrs. Trimmer was to follow in her Bible
lessons. Full as the days were, Madame de Genlis,
nevertheless, seems to have been able to give to her
children every care and attention. This must have
won the unstinted commendation of Rousseau, who
preached that a boy’s tutor should be his father,
and not a hired person.</p>

<p>Madame de Genlis created her own theatre; she
wrote little comedies of all kinds, which met with
great success. Often these would be presented in
the open air, upon platforms erected beneath the
shade of forest trees; by means of the drama she
sought to teach her daughters elementary lessons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of life; the stage to her was an educational force.
Through the plays her popularity and reputation
increased to such an extent, that the Electress of
Saxony demanded her friendship. She became instructress
to the children of the Duke and Duchess
of Chartres, and she prided herself upon being the
first in France to adopt the foreign method of teaching
language by conversation.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The rooms for
her royal pupils were fitted according to her special
indications. Rough sketches were made upon a
wall of blue, representing medals, busts of kings
and emperors of Rome. Dates and names were
frescoed within easy view. Every object was utilised,
even to the fire screens, which were made to represent
the kings of France; and over the balustrades
were flung maps, like banners upon the outer walls.</p>

<p>Up and down such staircases, and through such
rooms wandered the cultivated flowers of royalty.
They did not suffer, because their teacher was
luckily human as well as theoretical; because she
had a vein of humour as well as a large seriousness.
Her whole educational scheme is described in her
“Lessons of a Governess” and “Adèle et Théodore.”
When she engaged a tutor to attend to the special
studies of the young prince in her charge, she suggested
the keeping of an hourly journal which would
record the little fellow’s doings—each night she, herself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
to write critical comments upon the margins of
every page. In addition, she kept a faithful record
of everything coming within her own observation;
and this she read aloud each day to her pupils, who
had to sign their names to the entries. But much
to the chagrin of Madame de Genlis, the Duke and
Duchess refused to take the time to read the voluminous
manuscripts; they trusted to the wisdom
and discretion of the teacher.</p>

<p>Not a moment was lost during these busy periods;
history was played in the garden, and civic processions
were given with ponies gaily caparisoned. Even
a real theatre was built for them. Royalty was
taught to weave, and was taken on instructive walks
and on visits to instructive places. But, through all
this artificiality, the woman in Madame de Genlis
saved the teacher.</p>

<p>The latter part of her eventful life was filled with
vexations, for the thunders of the French Revolution
rolled about her. A short while before the storm
broke, she went on a visit to England, where she
came in contact with Fox and Sheridan, with Walpole
and Reynolds; and where she paid a special visit
to the House of Commons and was a guest at
Windsor.</p>

<p>All told, here was a writer for children, self-conscious
and yet ofttimes spontaneous in her style.
She is interesting because of herself, and in spite of
many of her literary attempts. She is little read
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
to-day, in fact rarely mentioned among juvenile book
lists; education killed a keen perception and vivacity
by forcing them along prescribed lines. One
glimpse of Madame de Genlis in old age is recorded
by Maria Edgeworth, who called on her in 1803.</p>

<p>“She came forward, and we made our way towards
her as well as we could, through a confusion
of tables, chairs, and work-baskets, china, writing-desks
and inkstands, and bird-cages and a harp....
She looked like the full-length picture of my great-great-grandmother
Edgeworth you may have seen
in the garret, very thin and melancholy, but her face
not so handsome as my great-grandmother’s; dark
eyes, long sallow cheeks, compressed, thin lips, two
or three black ringlets on a high forehead, a cap
that Mrs. Grier might wear,—altogether an appearance
of fallen fortunes, worn-out health, and
excessive but guarded <span id='cor_73'>irritability</span>. To me there
was nothing of that engaging, captivating manner
which I had been taught to expect by many even
of her enemies; she seemed to me to be alive only
to literary quarrels and jealousies; the muscles of
her face as she spoke, or as my father spoke to her,
quickly and too easily expressed hatred and anger
whenever any not of her own party were mentioned.”</p>

<p>A frontispiece to the 1802 edition of Arnaud
Berquin’s (1749–1791) works represents his bust
being garlanded and crowned, and his “L’Ami des
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Enfans” being regarded by a group of admirers,
both young and old. But though this very volume
was received with honours by the French Academy,
and though by it Berquin claims his right to immortality,
French children of the present refrain from
reading him as systematically as we refrain from
reading “Sandford and Merton,” which, as it happens,
Berquin translated into French. There are
popular editions of “L’Ami des Enfans,” but
children do not relish the tameness of such moral
literature. The editor detailed to write Berquin’s
short life, which was spent in the study of letters,
and in following up one “Ami” by another, sacrifices
incident and fact for encomium. It is easy
to claim for Berquin modesty and goodness during
his residence in his native town near Bordeaux and
after his arrival in Paris during 1772; it is interesting
to know that he was encouraged to use his talents
by the praise of his friends, but far more valuable
would it have been to tell just in what manner he
reached that ethical state which overflowed in his
“L’Ami des Enfans,” published during the years
1782 and 1783. The full purport of the volume
is summed up exuberantly in the following paragraph:</p>

<p>“Quelle aimable simplicité! quel naturel! quel
sentiment naïf respirent dans cette ingénieuse production!
Au lieu de ces fictions extravagantes, et
de ce merveilleux bizarre dans lesquels on a si longtemps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
égaré l’imagination des enfans, Berquin ne
leur présente que des aventures dont ils peuvent
être témoins chaque jour dans leur famille.”</p>

<p>The tales and playlets written by Berquin are
almost immoral in their morality. It is a question
whether the interest of children will become absorbed
by the constant iteration of virtue; whether
goodness is best developed through the exploitation
of deceit, of lying, of disobedience, and of wilful
perverseness. To be kind means to be rewarded,
to be bad is synonymous with punishment. Berquin
and his followers might have drawn up a moral
code book in pocket form, so stereotyped was their
habit of exacting an eye for an eye and a tooth for
a tooth. What are the punishments of vanity, what
the outcome of playing when the afternoon task is
to watch the sheep? The pictures made to illustrate
the stories depict boys and girls kneeling in supplication,
while the grown persons almost invariably
stand in disdainful attitude. The children who
would be their own masters and go out in a boat,
despite parental warning, are upset: there is the
algebraic formula. “Plainness the Dress of Use”
is probably a worthy subject for a tale, and “A
Good Heart Compensates for Many Indiscretions”
a pathetic title for a play. But young people as a
general rule are not maudlin in their feelings; even
granting that there are some given that way, they
should not be encouraged in holding a flabby standard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
of human, as well as of divine, justice. “L’Ami
des Enfans” is filled with such sentimental mawkishness.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Edgeworths; Thomas Day; Mrs. Barbauld;
and Dr. Aikin.</span></h3>

<p>At the early age of twenty-three, Richard Lovell
Edgeworth (1744–1817) decided to educate his son,
Richard, according to the principles set down by
Rousseau. He thrust the little fellow back into a
state of nature by taking his shoes and stockings off
and by cutting the arms from all his jackets. But,
try as he did in every way to make a living Émile out
of young Richard, the father found that the theories
did not work. When he took the luckless boy to
Paris and called upon Rousseau, there ensued an
examination of results, and the sum-total was pronounced
a failure. Hon. Emily Lawless writes in
some glee:</p>

<p>“It is impossible to read without a smile of the
eminently unphilosophic wrath expressed by the sage,
because each time that a handsome horse or vehicle
passed them on their walk, his temporary charge—a
child of seven—invariably cried out, ‘That’s an
English horse!’ ... a view which he solemnly
pronounced to be due to a sadly early ‘propensity
to party prejudice’!...”</p>

<p>Edgeworth lost entire faith in the practical application
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
of the Rousseau scheme in after years; but the
lasting effect it seems to have produced upon the
unfortunate victim was to place him in the ranks of
mediocrity, for he was hardly ever spoken of thereafter
by his family; and in order to remove himself
from further disturbance, as soon as he reached
years of discretion, he hastened to place miles between
himself and the scenes of his youth; Richard came
to America.</p>

<p>Edgeworth’s love affairs—for four times he was
married—are involved, and do not concern us,
save as they effect Thomas Day. But, personally,
he enters our plan as influencing his daughter,
Maria Edgeworth (1767–1849), with whom he wrote
“Practical Education.” There are some men—and
Edgeworth was bordering on the type—who
assume an almost dreadful position in a household;
who torture the mind of boy or girl by prying, and
by wishing to emphasise hidden meaning in everything;
who make children fear to ask questions lest
a lecture, dry and unoriginal, be the penalty. Such
men have a way of fixing youth with intense, severe
gaze—of smiling with a fiendish self-complacency
over their own superiority—of raising their eyebrows
and reprimanding should the child be watching
the flight of a sparrow instead of being ever alert
for an unexpected question or bit of information
which a grown person might put to him on earth.
Such men are the kind who make presents of Cobbet’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
“Advice to Young Men,” and who write
mistaken sentiments of nobility on the fly-leaf of
Samuel Smiles’s “Self-Help.”</p>

<p>Edgeworth’s redeeming trait was his earnest desire
to bring the best within reach of his children,
and he considered his severity the proper kind of
guidance for them. Whatever sin of commission is
to be laid to his charge, it is nevertheless true that
it was not so great as to destroy the love Maria had
for him. The literary critic has to reckon with the
total amount of effect his teaching, his personal
views had upon the writings of his daughter. That
he did influence her is certain, and nowhere more
thoroughly shown than in her work for children.
In theory this work traces its origin to Rousseau,
while in its modelling it bears a close relationship
to Madame de Genlis and to Berquin.</p>

<p>Banish dolls is the cry in “Practical Education,”
and if you have toys in the nursery at all, let them
be of a useful character—not mechanical novelties,
but cubes, cylinders, and the like. Place before
children only those pictures which deal with familiar
objects, and see to it that the pose of every figure,
where there are figures, is natural; a boy once went
with Sir Joshua Reynolds through an art gallery,
and invariably he turned with displeasure away from
any form represented in a constrained attitude.
This is the general tone of the Edgeworths as
teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>The set notions that fill the pages of “Practical
Education” often border on the verge of bathos.
They leave no room for the exercise of spontaneous
inclination; by their limitations, they recognise no
great amount of common sense in others. They
create in one a desire at times to laugh, and again
a desire to shake the authors who were in the frame
of mind to hold such views. There are certain
instincts which are active by reason of their own
natures,—and one is the love of parent for offspring.
We even accredit the wild animal with this quality.
When the Edgeworths declare that “My dear, have
you nothing to do?” should be spoken in sorrow,
rather than in anger, the advice irritates; it is
platitudinous; it must have irritated many naturally
good mothers, even in those days when such a tone
in writers was more the rule than the exception.</p>

<p>On the subject of books Miss Edgeworth and her
father become more interesting, though none the
less startling in their suggestions. One of Maria’s
early tasks in 1782 had been to translate “Adèle
et Théodore”; to her this book was worthy of
every consideration. In the choice of reading for
young folks, the two do not reach very much beyond
their own contemporaries: Mrs. Barbauld’s “Lessons,”
the Aikin’s “Evenings at Home,” Berquin’s
“L’Ami des Enfans,” Day’s “Sandford and Merton”
were recommended. And in addition there were
mentioned Madame de Silleri’s stories, known as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the “Theatre of Education,” Madame de la Fite’s
“Tales” and “Conversations,” and Mrs. Smith’s
“Rural Walks.” Despite the fact that fairy tales
are at this period frowned upon as useless frivolities,
“Robinson Crusoe,” “Gulliver’s Travels,” “The
Three Russian Sailors,” and the “Arabian Nights’
Entertainment” are suggested because of the interest
and profit to be had in voyages and travels of all
kinds. Fancy was thus held at a discount.</p>

<p>Two books of nature are mentioned, and curiously
one is emphasised as of special value for children
provided it is beforehand judiciously cut or blotted
out here and there. The Edgeworths obtained this
idea from an over-careful mother who was in the
habit of acting as censor and editor of all juvenile
books that found their way into her house. In
Russia, the authorities take an ink pad and stamp
out the condemned passages of any book officially
examined. In the same summary manner, English
parents were advised to treat their children’s stories.
The Edgeworths went even further, suggesting that,
besides striking out separate words with a pen, it
would be well to cut the undesirable paragraphs
from the page, provided by so doing the sense of
the text on the reverse side was not materially interfered
with. To mark the best thoughts for young
readers was also strongly recommended.</p>

<p>The authors are never wanting in advice. If
children are good, what need is there to introduce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
them to evil in their stories? Evil is here meant in
its mildest sense. They should be kept from all
contagion. But bad boys and girls should be told
to read, in “The Children’s Friend,” tales like “The
Little Gamblers” and “Honesty is the Best Policy,”
which will teach them, by examples of wickedness,
to correct their ways. Such strange classification
suggests that literature was to be used as a species
of moral reformatory. Two significant facts are
to be noted in this chapter on books: there is an
attempt to grade the literature by some age standard,
bringing to light a gap between four and seven years
which may be offset by a similar gap to-day; so,
too, does there seem to have been, then as now, a
great lack of history and biography.</p>

<p>The idea upon which the “Parent’s Assistant”
was founded began to shape itself in Miss Edgeworth’s
mind early in life. Left alone for a short
period with her younger brothers and sisters, she
manufactured tales for their edification, many of
which, in after years, she utilised. In 1796 she
gathered together and published some of her best
stories, among them “The Purple Jar” and “Lazy
Laurence.” “Simple Susan” would probably not
be so widely emphasised were it not for the fact that
Sir Walter Scott recorded “that when the boy brings
back the lamb to the little girl, there is nothing for
it but to put down the book and cry.”</p>

<p>Miss Edgeworth and her father had much preferred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
that the book be called “The Parent’s Friend,” for
lodged in the former’s memory were disagreeable
thoughts of an old-time arithmetic which had
plagued her early years, and was named “The
Tutor’s Assistant.”</p>

<p>The theatricals performed in the Edgeworth
household afforded much pleasure. It is very
likely that the custom was gleaned from Madame
de Genlis. Plays were written for every festive
season. The publication of the “Parent’s Assistant”
suggested the acting of some of the playlets
contained in the book. There seem to have been
two theatres, one fitted up just over Richard Lovell’s
study, and another temporary stage erected in the
dining-room. Here, one evening, was enacted the
exemplary dialogue of “Old Poz,” where a poor
man is suspected, by a Justice, of stealing what a
magpie has in reality secreted. Lucy, the good
little daughter, clears the innocent fellow, upon
whom her father sits in very stern, very unreasonable,
and most unnatural judgment. Irritable to a degree,
the Justice, who is positive about everything, shuts
up any one who gainsays a word contrary to his
obstinacy, but “Oh, darling,” he remarks to his
daughter, after her excellent deed, “<em>you</em> shall contradict
me as often as you please.” This method is
neither more nor less than poisonous; it is polluted
with a certain license which no good action ever
sanctions. There is small doubt that children see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the absurdity of it, for it cheapens right-doing in
their eyes.</p>

<p>The compensating balance of good and bad is
exercised to a monotonous degree in Miss Edgeworth’s
tales. There are the meek, innocent girl,
and the proud, overbearing girl in “The Bracelet”;
the heedless, extravagant boy, and the thoughtful,
thrifty boy in “Waste Not, Want Not.” Disaster
follows disaster; reward courts reward. Not
content with using these extremes of human nature
in one story, Miss Edgeworth rings the changes,
slightly altered in form, in others of her tales.</p>

<p>“The Purple Jar” in substance is the same as
“Waste Not, Want Not”; the moral applications
are identical. One has but to glance through the
pages of the latter story to note its didactic pattern.
Yet Miss Edgeworth possessed her literary excellencies
in human characterisation, in that power of
narrative which gained effect, not through ornamentation,
but through deep knowledge of the real qualities
of common existence. The dominant fault is that she
allowed her ultimate object to become crystallised
into an overshadowing bulwark, a danger which
always besets the “moral” writer, and produces the
ethical teacher in a most obtruding form. When
Miss Edgeworth’s little girl sprains her ankle and
her father picks her up, she consciously covers her
leg with her gown. Fate seems never to have worked
so swiftly, so determinedly, as in those tales where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
thoughtless boys on their walks had the consequences
of their bad acts visited upon them during the homeward
journey. The hungry, the lame, the halt,
the blind turn unexpected corners, either to wince
beneath the jeers of one type of mortal child, or to
smile thanks to the other kind for a gentle word or
a much-needed penny.</p>

<p>No one can wholly condemn the tale, typified by
Miss Edgeworth’s “Parent’s Assistant.” Childhood
is painted in quaint, old-fashioned colours, even
though the staid little heroes and heroines have no
interests. They take information into their minds
as they would take physic into their bodies. They
are all normal types, subjected to abnormal and unnaturally
successive temptations, and given very exacting
consciences. A writer in <cite>Blackwood’s</cite> becomes
indignant over such literary treatment:</p>

<p>“They [the girls] have good reason to expect
from these pictures of life, that if they are very good
and very pious, and very busy in doing grown-up
work, when they reach the mature age of sixteen or
so, some young gentleman, who has been in love with
them all along, will declare himself at the very nick of
time; and they may then look to find themselves,
all the struggles of life over, reposing a weary head
on his stalwart shoulder.... Mothers, never in
great favour with novelists, are sinking deeper and
deeper in their black books,—there is a positive
jealousy of their influence; while the father in the religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
tale, as opposed to the moral and sentimental,
is commonly either a scamp or nowhere. The heroine
has, so to say, to do her work single-handed.”</p>

<p>What is true of these young people is therefore
likewise true of their grown-up associates. They
have definite personalities, and they are either
monstrosities of excellence or demons of vice and
temper. But here also a careful distinction was
preserved. Mr. Lucas says in his “Old-Fashioned
Tales”:</p>

<p>“The parents who can do no wrong are very
numerous; but they are, it should be pointed out,
usually the parents of the central child. There are
very often parents and relations of other and subsidiary
children whose undesirable habits are exceedingly
valuable by way of contrast.”</p>

<p>Despite the fact that there is so much to condemn
in this <i lang='la'>genre</i> of writing, Miss Edgeworth was endowed
with that sober sense and inexhaustible power of
invention claimed for her by critics of the period.
Her care for detail, her exhibition of small actions
that mark the manners of all people in different
walks of life, were distinguishing features of her
skill.</p>

<p>With her father Miss Edgeworth laboured on other
things besides the “Practical Education”; while
the two were preparing the essay on “Irish Bulls,”
published in 1802, she plainly states that the first
design was due to him, and that in her own share
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
she was sedulously following the ideas suggested by
him. Throughout her autobiographical data she
offers us many glimpses of that family unity which
existed—whether from voluntary desire or because
of the domineering grip of Edgeworth, is not stated.
She was continuously solicitous for his welfare, not
through any forced sense of duty, but because of
her desire to give pleasure in small ways; she found
it agreeable to sit of an evening doing needle work,
while Edgeworth “read out” Pope’s Homer. In
the course of such hours she first became acquainted
with Scott’s “Lady of the Lake” and “Waverley.”</p>

<p>The friendship between Miss Edgeworth and
Scott was deep and cordial; one was not without
abiding influence on the other. She describes with
graphic pen the first sound of his voice at Abbotsford;
and the biographer has no more agreeable
material to work upon than her fortnight spent as a
guest of the novelist, and his return visit to Edgeworthtown
in 1825.</p>

<p>For a man whose avowed detestation of women
was well known to every one, Thomas Day (1748–1789)
succeeded in leading a life of romantic variety.
Yet he was not a person of strong passion; in fact,
was more inclined to brooding melancholy. His
intimacy with the Edgeworth family began when
he met Richard Lovell at Oxford; and it was when
he saw the training of Émile applied to his friend’s
son that his mind was seized with the idea of carrying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
out a similar scheme himself. He held a great
contempt for dress; and his numerous vagaries
regarding the conduct and duties of a wife were so
pronounced that it is most likely they came between
himself and Maria Edgeworth, with whom it is
thought there was some romantic understanding.</p>

<p>Unlike Edgeworth, Day had no child to experiment
upon. So he set about “breeding up” two
girls, away from conflicting influences, and according
to nature. One was obtained from an orphan
asylum, and was known as Sabrina Sidney; the
other, called Lucretia, was taken from a Foundling
Hospital. In order to give a moral tone to the
situation, these girls were bound out to Edgeworth,
who was a married man. Not many knew that Day
had hastened with both of the damsels to Avignon.
Here he began to educate them with the intention
of training one for his future wife.</p>

<p>Events did not progress smoothly, however; the
girls quarrelled as saints would have quarrelled
under the circumstances, and they occupied their
time by falling out of boats and having smallpox.
What their schooling consisted of may be imagined
from the fragment of a letter written by Sabrina
to Mr. Edgeworth:</p>

<p>“I hope I shall have more sense against I come
to England—I know how to make a circle and an
equilateral triangle—I know the cause of day and
night, winter and summer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>At the advanced age of twenty-two—even younger
than Edgeworth when he first became imbued with
the Rousseau doctrines—Day returned to Lichfield—the
home of Johnson and of Dr. Charles Darwin—bringing
with him his charges: Lucretia, who was
hopelessly dull, and Sabrina, who proved the
favourite and was by far the more attractive of the
two, with her fetching auburn ringlets, her long
amorous eyelashes, and her very melodious voice.
The young ladies had failed to become thoroughly
steeled against the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune. In most respects they persisted in remaining
like the average woman with sensibility. When
hot sealing-wax was dropped upon the shapely arm
of Sabrina, to harden her against the fear of pain,
she refused to behave heroically; when a pistol
was fired at her petticoats—a volley of lead for all
she knew—her screams and frantic jumps indicated
that her nerves were not impervious to the unexpected.</p>

<p>Day did not fail to show his disgust and disappointment.
While Sabrina was at boarding-school, he
hastened to forget all about her, and fell in love with
Honora Sneyd, whose fame chiefly rests upon the
fact that she was once courted by Major André.
To make the situation more awkward, Edgeworth,
despite his married state, likewise possessed strong
affection for the same lady. She refused Day, and
what followed contains the zest of a wicked little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
comedy. He fell ill, and had to be bled; then he
summoned up sufficient strength to escape to
France with Edgeworth, who felt it best to remove
himself from temptation. It was during this trip
that he visited Rousseau with poor little Richard.
But before crossing the Channel, Day had succeeded
in transferring his affections to Honora’s sister,
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Go,” she said to him in substance, “try to assume
some of the graces that you sorely lack. Learn to
dress stylishly, and be taught the proper curl for
a wig. Train yourself into a fashionable-looking
husband, and come back to me.”</p>

<p>Thus commanded, Day spent many weary hours
wielding the foil, and being carried through the
intricacies of the dance. And those legs of his—how
he put them into exercise, hoping against hope
to straighten them ere he returned to England!</p>

<p>But there was evidently no improvement in the
end, for when the lady saw him, she unhesitatingly
refused him. It is sufficient to say that, in time,
Edgeworth married both sisters, Death regarding
kindly his love of novelty.</p>

<p>With affections thus left high and dry, Day turned
once more to Sabrina. He had long ago discarded
Lucretia, who apprenticed herself to a milliner, and
later became the wife of an honest draper. But
Sabrina was fair to look upon and Day saw no reason
why she should not satisfy his ideas of wifehood,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
provided she would dress according to his tastes.
We applaud the shake of those auburn ringlets as
she refused his wishes, and thus escaped matrimony
with him.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> There was another lady upon whom
this honour was to descend.</p>

<p>When Miss Milnes, of Wakefield, was approached
by Day, she was informed of all his requirements,
and was deceived as to none of his vagaries. It must
have been somewhat of a surprise to him when she
accepted him, outlandish attire and all; and it is
a pleasant disappointment to know that the marriage
was a happy one, despite the fact that Mrs. Day
insisted upon holding opinions of her own.</p>

<p>Day was most content when he was theorising;
at the same time, it must not be lost sight of that he
had timely interests. His feelings were strongly
aroused against the state of negro slavery in America,
and he was earnest in his advocacy of parliamentary
reform. His great fault was that he was
always carried to extremes whenever good motives
prompted him. His earnest concern for the poor,
during 1781, was accompanied by stern denials of
pleasures for himself,—well-nigh of the necessities
of life.</p>

<p>Day realised the failures of his theories as applied
to grown people; had he not done so, we most likely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
would not have had “Sandford and Merton.” His
attention was soon attracted to the infant mind as
an unworked field; the Edgeworths were meeting
success with their children’s books; he would attempt
the same thing, and so, during 1783, 1787,
and 1789, the three successive volumes of his famous
story appeared—an elongated “Waste Not, Want
Not.”</p>

<p>Day had heretofore suggested a certain effeminate
bearing in his character; he recognised it, and was
now suddenly beset with a consuming desire to
supplant this manner by an overtowering manliness,
by the exercise of firmness and strength. But the
new policy was to prove his undoing. On the afternoon
of September 28, 1789, he went to ride on an
unbroken horse, believing to curb him by the discipline
of command rather than of the stock. The
animal took fright and threw him; he received injuries
from which he almost immediately died. On
the evidence of Miss Seward, it is recorded that
Mrs. Day thereafter “lay in bed, into the curtains
of which no light was admitted, ... and only rose
to stray alone through her garden when night gave
her sorrows congenial gloom.”</p>

<p>The estimate of such a work as “Sandford and
Merton” cannot be based upon modern standards;
all of the factors characteristic of the didactic writers
for children, such as persistent questioning, the
encyclopædic grown person in the shape of Mr.&nbsp;Barlow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
and the monotonous interchange of narrative
and dialogue, are employed as vehicles for knowledge.
The book is unique, inasmuch as it sought
to supply a variety of stories suitable in style and
content for the beginner.</p>

<p>“The only method I could invent,” writes Day,
“was to select such passages of different books as
were most adapted to their experience and understanding.
The least exceptionable that I could find
for this purpose were Plutarch’s Lives, and Zenophon’s
History of the Institution of Cyrus, in English
translations; with some part of Robinson
Crusoe, and a few passages in the first volume of
Mr. Brook’s Fool of Quality.”</p>

<p>In those days, if authors are to be believed, birds
were in the habit of alighting on the hands of good
children; they are more timid now, though children
are not less good. The poor boy was made to feel
how kind the good rich boy was to him throughout
his shocking adversity; we are more considerate
to-day. And so, Tommy Merton and
Harry Sandford, products of a stilted age, are clad
in uniforms similar to those worn by Miss Edgeworth’s
children. They are endowed with no exceptional
qualities, with no defined will power; they
stand in a long row of similarly subjected slaves of
theory.</p>

<p>Miss Agnes Repplier calls this story one of her
early moral pitfalls. She read it at a period when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
information was being forced down her, and
“which,” so she writes, “I received as responsively
as does a Strassburg goose its daily share of
provender.”</p>

<p>Among the writers of this period, none are more
important than Anna Letitia Aikin Barbauld (1743–1825).
Her position is a unique one, for, being acquainted
with all of her literary contemporaries and
subject to their influence, she stands in a transition
stage. Through her mental independence, she succeeded
partially in breaking from the introspective
method of motive-hunting, and foreshadowed the
possibilities of Mrs. Hemans, the Brontés, and Mrs.
Browning. She was reared in an atmosphere of intellectuality
by her father, John Aikin, a professor
and a man of advanced opinions regarding female
instruction, two points which argued for her less
conventional mind and for her less stilted manner.</p>

<p>When she married Rochemont Barbauld, who
had been a student under her father, and who was a
non-conformist, she was well versed in Greek and
Latin, and in every way was equipped to do
literary work. She was more or less influenced by
her husband’s religious independence; he changed
his congregation from English Presbyterianism to
Unitarianism, and it is not surprising to find the
English public looking somewhat askance at Mrs.
Barbauld’s fitness to write for children. Madame
de Genlis was in like fashion criticised for the religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
views she held, and we shall find Miss More
subject to the same scrutiny. The Aikins were the
first to introduce the material lines in children’s
literature, “but the more anxiously religious mothers
felt a certain distrust of the absence of direct lessons in
Christian doctrines; and Mrs. Trimmer was incited to
begin a course of writing for young people that might
give the one thing in which, with all their far superior
brilliancy, the Aikins were felt to be deficient.”</p>

<p>We are not concerned with all of Mrs. Barbauld’s
work; she used to write poetry, some of it in repartee
vein which struck the acute fancy of Charles Lamb;
her essays were of an exceptional order, in a few
instances expressed in imitation of Johnson; he
himself had to acknowledge that of all who tried to
ape him, she was most successful. Her educational
opinions, sent from time to time in letters to Mrs.
Montague, marked her ability as a teacher; but the
method that she believed in was well nigh Socratic
and ofttimes wearisome in its persistency; history
and geography were given to infant minds in
the form of lectures. Around 1802 William Godwin,
of whom we shall have something to say later in his
connection with the Lambs, wrote:</p>

<p>“I think Mrs. Barbauld’s little books admirably
adapted, upon the whole, to the capacity and amusement
of young children.... As far as Mrs.
Barbauld’s books are concerned, I have no difficulty.
But here my judgment and the ruling passion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
my contemporaries divide. They aim at cultivating
one faculty; I should aim at cultivating another....
Without imagination, there can be no
genuine ardour in any pursuit or for any acquisition,
and without imagination there can be no genuine
morality, in profound feeling of other men’s sorrow,
no ardent and persevering anxiety for their interests.
This is the faculty which makes the man, and not
the miserable minuteness of detail about which the
present age is so uneasy.”</p>

<p>Childless herself, Charles Aikin was adopted by
Mrs. Barbauld, the little Charles of “Early Lessons
for Children,” composed especially for him. The
latter work was followed by “Hymns in Prose for
Children,” consisting of translations from all tongues,
put into simple language, and not into verse, for
fear they might fail to reach the comprehension
otherwise. These hymns are probably most representative
of Mrs. Barbauld’s individual writings,
for the work by which she is best known, the
“Evenings at Home,” was written in collaboration
with her brother, Dr. Aikin.</p>

<p>In the “Evenings” a new tone is detected; despite
a stilted style, the two authors aroused an interest in
external objects, and, by their descriptions and suggestions,
attempted to infuse meaning into the world
surrounding the child. This small departure from
the sectarian tendency prevailing in so much of the
literature of that period, imperceptible though it may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
be, was due to a shifting of attitude toward women
which was taking place in England. Mrs. Barbauld
might be considered a “bold” example of feminine
intellect reaching out for a larger sphere. We read
that Fox was surprised that a woman could exhibit
such clearness and consistency of viewpoint as were
to be discovered in such of her essays as “Monastic
Institutions”; and there were others who wondered
at the alertness and interest she manifested in all
matters pertaining to public affairs. Her force of
intellect pleased some, her manner others. Scott
confessed that her public reading of poetry inspired
him to court the muse; Wordsworth unfolded so far
as to envy the beauty of her stanzas on “Life,”
which toward the end contain these attractive, hopeful,
and faith-abiding lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Life! we’ve been long together,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis hard to part when friends are dear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps ’twill cost a sigh, a tear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then steal away, give little warning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Choose thine own time;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say not good-night, but in some brighter clime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bid me good-morning.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld was one of a group of women
writers, seeking through the force of their opinions
to destroy the conventional barriers which kept the
exercise of feminine minds within prescribed bounds.
Harriet Martineau has outlined the tyrannical
limitations which beset a young girl of the early
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
nineteenth century; decorum stood for mental annihilation.
When genteel persons came to call at the
home of Jane Austen, the latter, out of regard for
family feeling, and for fear of being thought forward
and unmaidenly, was constrained to cover her manuscript
with a muslin scarf.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld did not make any revolutionary
declaration, nor attempt any public defiance of
custom; however, she did, by her reaching toward
the manifest facts of life, secularise our concern for
the common things about us. She encouraged,
through her plea for the freedom of thought, the
movement which resulted in the emancipation of
her sex, and which found vent, on the one hand, in
Mary Wollstonecraft’s<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> “The Right of Woman”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
(1792) and, on the other, with more determined force,
in John Stuart Mill’s “On the Subjection of Women”
(1869). As this freedom became more and more
assured, there underwent a change in the educational
attitude; a girl’s mind had something more to work
on than the motto of a sampler; her occupations
became somewhat altered. And the women writers
began to emphasise, in their stories for children,
the individual inclinations of hero and heroine.</p>

<p>Wherever Charles Lamb discourses upon books,
he assumes the critical attitude that deals with
literature as a living force, as something built for
human appeal. He met Mrs. Barbauld and Mrs.
Trimmer on several occasions, and we can imagine
the delight he took in shocking their ladylike senses
by his witty and sudden remarks. At one period
some dispute and ill-feeling existed between himself
and Mrs. Barbauld, due to a false report that she
had lampooned his drama, “John Woodvil.”</p>

<p>Elia was not the sort of literary devotee to sanction
anemic literature for children; his plea was for the
vitalising of the nursery book. On October 23, 1802,
he wrote to Coleridge:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barbauld’s stuff has banished all the old
classics, ... and the shopman at Newbery’s hardly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
deign’d to reach them off an exploded corner of a
shelf, when Mary ask’d for them. Mrs. B’s and Mrs.
Trimmer’s nonsense lay in piles about. Knowledge
insignificant and vapid as Mrs. B’s books convey, it
seems, must come to a child in the shape of knowledge,
and his empty noddle must be turned with conceit
of his own powers, when he has learnt that a horse
is an animal, and Billy is better than a horse, and
such like; instead of that beautiful interest in wild
tales which made the child a man while all the time
he suspected himself to be no bigger than a child.”</p>

<p>He saw the penalty that lay in cramming the child
with natural history instead of furnishing him with
some creative appeal. We can forgive Elia all his
pranks when he thus pleads the genial claim of
imagination; if, in a witty vein, he called Mrs.
Barbauld and Mrs. Inchbald the “bald” old women,
we must understand that Lamb had his petulant
hours, and that children’s literature of the day was
sufficient to increase them!</p>

<p>The purport of “Evenings at Home” is instruction.
Within the compass of a few pages, objects
crowd one upon the other as thick and as fast as
virtues do in Miss Edgeworth. Such keenness and
alertness in observing common things, as are cultivated
in “Eyes and No Eyes,” stagger the intellect.
It is well to teach your young companions to feel
the hidden possibilities of nature and to cultivate
within them a careful observation; but there is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
vacation time for the mind, and the world, though
it may be a school-room, is also a very healthy place
to play in. Mr. Andrews, the immaculate teacher,
is represented by the artist, in my copy of the book,
as seated in a chair, with a compass in one hand
resting upon a book, while behind him stretches the
outline of a map; the two boys stand in front of him
like prisoners before the bar. Here then is a new algebraic
formula in the literature for the young.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld thus represents a transition stage
in juvenile writing; education and narrative walk
side by side. She made it possible, in the future,
for Peter Parley and for Rollo to thrive. Thomas
Day foreshadowed the method of retelling incidents
from the classics and from standard history and
travel,—a form which is practised to a great extent
by our present writers, who thread diverse materials
on a slender wire of subsidiary story, and who, like
Butterworth and Knox, invent untiring families of
travellers who go to foreign parts, who see things, and
then who talk out loud about them.</p>

<p>But before this secularisation gained marked
hold, a new tributary is to be noted, which flowed
into the moral stream,—a tributary which afforded
the moral impulse a definite field to work in, which
centred its purpose upon a distinct class. For
heretofore the writers of juvenile literature had
aimed for a general appeal. The struggle was now
to be between the Sunday-school and the text-book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Sunday-school; Raikes; Hannah
More; Mrs.&nbsp;Trimmer.</span></h3>

<p>If the Sunday-school movement had not assumed
some proportions about this time, it would have been
necessary to create a practical outlet for the moral
energy which dominated the authors of whom we
have been writing. Had Robert Raikes not conceived
his plan when he did, the ethical impulse
would have run riot in a much wilder fashion, and
would have done no good at all. For, whatever
may be said against the old-time Sunday-school in
a critical vein, one cannot ignore that its establishment
brought immediate benefit. As it was, the
new institution furnished the objective point for
which the didactic school was blindly groping, and
developed the idea of personal service. The social
ideal was beginning to germinate.</p>

<p>Robert Raikes (1735 or 6–1811) was by profession
a printer. He was of benevolent disposition and
met with much to arouse his sympathy for the lower
classes, whom he found indifferent to religion and
hopelessly uncouth in their daily living. With the religious
revival which swept through England around
1770, caused by the preaching of George Whitefield,
Raikes began his work in earnest, first among the
city prisons, where he was brought in contact with
surprising conditions which had long lain in obscurity
because of a wide-spread public indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>His observation thus trained to follow along this
particular social line, he soon became attracted toward
the children apprenticed to a certain pin
factory. He saw that the discipline of work, however
exacting, however it denied them the care and
attention due to all young persons, was the only
restrictive guidance they had. When Sunday came,
they ran wild, relieved of duty, and not imbued with
any idea of personal control. Their elders were
living immoral lives; they had no opportunity or
incentive to improve; and their natural inclination
was to follow animal impulse and blind desire. To
such a religious man as Raikes, the mandate, “Suffer
little children to come unto me,” was most naturally
suggested by such circumstances. Some means of
occupying these children on the Sabbath day must
be devised.</p>

<p>So it was that on January 26, 1781, the first Sunday-school
was opened. Raikes poured his whole
energy into organization, and, through the medium of
his own paper, the Gloucester <cite>Journal</cite>, spread broadcast
his written suggestions about the work to be
done, and his descriptions of the particular localities
which most needed attention. He was in a position
to gain publicity, and his own personal earnestness
counted for a great deal. Already we have noted his
relationship to Newbery, whose literary connections
probably afforded Raikes some assistance.</p>

<p>The movement had been of five years’ growth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
when, in 1786, Raikes was summoned before King
George III. Their Majesties, both the King and
Queen, were interested by what they had heard, and
wished to know something more. The Queen was
being almost daily enthused through the intensity
of Mrs. Trimmer’s pleadings. This good lady,
already known for her children’s books, had put into
operation a Sunday-school of her own at Brentwood,
and it was to this that the King had paid a memorable
visit, leaving behind him a reputation for “kind and
condescending behaviour,” which won the hearts of
all the children. In this way was the official sanction
placed upon Christianity as a practical force;
there was even every prospect of starting a Sunday-school
at Windsor. “A general joy reigns among
the conductors,” cried the enthusiastic Mrs. Trimmer,
when she realised what interest was being
shown in every quarter.</p>

<p>The programme framed for Raikes’s little protégés
was indeed sufficiently full to keep them from
the highways. He writes:</p>

<p>“The children were to come after ten in the morning,
and stay till twelve; they were then to go home
and return at one; and after reading a lesson, they
were to be conducted to Church. After Church,
they were to be employed in repeating the catechism
till after five, and then dismissed, with an injunction
to go home without making a noise.”</p>

<p>Lamb and Leigh Hunt, when together at Christ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Hospital, were regarded as veritable monks in their
knowledge of the Bible; but these little waifs were
slaves of a rigorous order; there was nothing voluntary
in their desire for spiritual light. The time
was to arrive when more sunshine was to be mixed
with the teaching, but in the beginning it was necessary
for Raikes to keep the Sabbath forcibly observed
rather than to devise a less exacting routine.
He went about, untiring in his efforts; he plead personally
with parents, besides hoping that, through
the moral instruction being given to their children,
they might be made to see the outlet for their own
salvation.</p>

<p>Years after, testimony was obtained from the
survivors of Raikes’s discipline. One William
Brick had been a scholar of his, and the memory of
those days was vivid—perhaps a little too much so,
but none the less picturesque:</p>

<p>“I can remember Mr. Raikes well enough,” he
said. “I remember his caning me. I don’t suppose
I minded it much. He used to cane boys on the
back of a chair. Some terrible bad chaps went to
school when I first went.... I know the parents
of one or two of them used to walk them to school
with 14-lb. weights tied to their legs, to keep them
from running away.... When a boy was very
bad, he would take him out of the school, and march
him home and get his parents to ‘wallop’ him. <em>He’d
stop and see it done</em>, and then bring the young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
urchin back, rubbing his eyes and other places....
Every one in the city loved and feared him.”</p>

<p>Such a scene is not prepossessing; nor does moral
suasion appear to have been as efficacious as the rod.
Besides which, Raikes had a way of looking at a
trembling victim through his reading-glass, and exclaiming
in thunderous voice: “Ah, I can see you
did not say your prayers this morning.” An old
man of eighty spoke of this circumstance with deep
feeling; and, in awe-stricken tones, he ended by saying:
“The boys believed he could see through stone
walls with that glass; <em>and it magnified his eye</em>, so that
they were sometimes frightened, and told wonderful
stories about what Mr. Raikes could do with his
wonderful glass.”</p>

<p>The immediate influence this movement had upon
children’s books was to create a demand for tracts.
Later on, after Thomas Carlyle, in 1839, had plead
the cause of London public libraries, it suggested a
special class of library as a part of the Sunday-school
machinery. A general call was raised for juvenile
books of a strictly religious nature, with an appeal
intended for a poorer class of readers. Miss Hannah
More represents the chief exponent of this grade of
writing. “All service ranks alike with God,” says
Browning. But these ladies, who were untiring in
their devotion to the cause, who were, in their parochial
character, forerunners of the social worker of
to-day, each was known through her special interest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
We speak of Miss Catherine Sinclair, author of
“Holiday House,” as the first to introduce benches
in the parks of Edinburgh, as the originator of
drinking-fountains, as the founder of cooking-depots;
of Priscilla Wakefield as the originator of savings-banks
for the poor; of Miss More as the author of
tracts; and of Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith, one of
the forgotten New-England writers, as the first to
draw attention to the condition of the newsboys.
Mrs. Trimmer, therefore, is justly connected with
the history of the development of Sunday-schools.</p>

<p>In a tabular indication of the trend of juvenile
literature, Sarah Kirby Trimmer (1741–1810) may
be said to have been a disciple of Madame de Genlis
and of Mrs. Barbauld, quite as much as a follower of
Rousseau and of Raikes; she inherited from her
father an overweening religious inclination, and
several glimpses of her in the society of the day reveal
how deeply seated her serious nature was. In
London she talked with Dr. Johnson, Mr. Gainsborough,
and Mr. Hogarth, and, through recognised
powers of reading aloud, she charmed many of her
friends. But it was a hopeless situation to cope with
in a young girl, when, a dispute having arisen between
Sir Joshua Reynolds and one of his friends,
Sarah, being called upon to settle the point—a doubtful
passage in “Paradise Lost”—drew the volume
from the pocket of her skirt! At twenty-one she was
married, destined to be the mother of six sons and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
six daughters, and no sooner was the first child born
than she directed all of her attention, as Madame de
Genlis did, to the subject of education.</p>

<p>Wearisome it is to come in contact with a person
of one idea. Mrs. Trimmer naïvely confesses in
her journal that she must have worn out the patience
of many a visitor with her views upon education.
As the years advanced, her opinions became more
narrowed and more sectarian.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimmer exhibited piety which was of the
emotional, almost of the hysterical kind, yet sincere
in its whole-souled acceptance of Bible truths. She
questioned nothing; she believed with a simple faith
that lacked proportion. One has to view her entirely
from the standpoint of this single interest
which had her under complete control. In her
“Guardian of Education” she dwelt much upon
the dangerous matter contained in children’s books;
in her “New Plan of Education” she condemned
any attempt to extend the scope of education for
the poor. Her chief motive in both cases was to
keep away from faith any cause of its possible undoing.
The earnestness put into her charity work,
her untiring devotion to the Sunday-school, a certain
gentle charm of conversation won for Mrs. Trimmer
wide-spread attention. Her life was guided by the
belief in a divine mission; her days were well ordered,
from the hours before breakfast, which she reserved
for the learning of poetry, to the evenings, when she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
would give herself up to meditation and prayer. In
fact, during twenty-five years, she kept a diary, penned
in secret moments of retreat, a curious display of
over-welling feeling—pietistical neurasthenia. These
pages are hardly to be considered interpretative—they
are outpourings, giving one an awful sense of
unworthiness, if life consists simply in submitting to
biblical strictures and in uttering biblical paraphrases.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Trimmer was withal an active little
woman, whose three hours, spent every Sunday over
her journal, represented meditation only: in her
practise of Christianity she was zealous; and her
pen was employed in preparing the kind of food to
foster a proper feeling among children and cottagers
and <em>servants</em>. In this latter respect there was a
change indeed from Miss Edgeworth, who considered
the advisability of separating young people entirely
from any possible contact with servants.</p>

<p>Among her children and her grandchildren, Mrs.
Trimmer exerted profound influence; the Sabbath
day was observed with great strictness; toys set aside
while Stackhouse’s “Commentary on the Bible”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
was brought forth to look at; stories were told, and
the progress of Bible heroes traced upon maps of the
Holy Land. The spirit of rest and peace followed
Mrs. Trimmer, who was averse to reading books of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
controversy. We are given a picture of her in her
venerable old age, walking with her grandson among
the plants and flowers, while she explained, with a
certain lyric simplicity, the truths, as she saw them
with her meek spirit, underlying the growth of the
grass; and described the flight of a sparrow which
escaped not the notice of God. There was thus
unfolded to this little boy the holiness of all things
in nature, permeated with a divine grace; he was
made to consider the lilies of the field, and not a
bush but might become to him a burning flame, not
a stone but might be rent asunder by the resurrection
of a dried-up seed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimmer’s “Easy Lessons for Children,”
her “Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature,”
her “Sacred History for Young Persons,” and
her works explaining the catechism, were among
the rare books available for the purposes of Raikes’s
followers. They were easily understood; they explained
satisfactorily for children, according to grown-up
standards, certain religious teachings. In the
Catholic church to-day, Mother Loyola is said to
possess that same ability to unfold the meaning
of the most difficult doctrine so that Catholic
children can understand. Priests turn to her books
rather than trust to their own interpretations. The
general interest aroused for the poor, for the lower
classes, appealed to Mrs. Trimmer; she became
wholly absorbed; she wrote “The Servant’s Friend”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and edited a “Family Magazine,” intended for
their special instruction and amusement. Adopting
Madame de Genlis’s idea of using prints as a factor
in nursery education, she prepared a series of illustrations
from ancient history and from the Old
Testament; and was further engaged in the simplification
of Roman and English history for young
readers.</p>

<p>The book that has come down to us as representing
Mrs. Trimmer’s work, “The History of the
Robins,” is a nature story of no mean value, easy in
narrative and full of appeal for very young persons
who are interested in simple incident. To American
readers it is now available in a cut-up state, for Dr.
Edward Everett Hale, in editing it, called the style
“stilted” and diffuse, and thought that its unity
could better be preserved by dealing only with the
robins, and not at all with the extraneous doings of
the Benson family.</p>

<p>When the Lambs removed to Enfield in 1827,
Thomas Westwood, a boy of thirteen, lived near them.
It was not long before he and Elia were on intimate
terms, and he must have had exceptional merit for
Lamb to give him free entrée to his books. “Lamb,”
so he has recorded, “initiated me into a school of literature
which Mrs. Trimmer might not have considered
the most salutary under the circumstances.
Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Farquhar, Defoe,
Fielding,—these were the pastures in which I delighted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
to graze in those early years; and which, in
spite of Trimmer, I believe did me less evil than
good.”</p>

<p>An alteration in attitude appears to have been
going on in several directions; the social strata
were readjusting themselves. For Hannah More
(1745–1833), it is claimed, stood at the parting of
the roadways, where clergymen and schoolmasters,
once frowned upon as quite inferior beings, now took
positions of a higher nature. Had Miss More not
thrown herself so heartily into the moral movement,
she might have occupied a much more important
position in English letters than she does. One cannot
help feeling that, by the part she took in the
Sunday-school development, she sacrificed her genius
to a cause. In the biographies of these well-intentioned
writers for children and for poor people, it is always
satisfactory to linger, wherever opportunity presents,
on the genial aspects of their lives; they are
estimated in criticism so greatly by the weight, or by
the lack of weight, of their ideas, that the human
value which existed at the time is often lost sight of.
However dry their preachments, their social lives
were warmed by human intercourse and human
service. It is hard to forget such a group as Scott,
Maria and Patty Edgeworth, and others, listening
to Patty while she sang Irish melodies. A similar
scene is associated with Sally and Hannah More
when they went to call on Dr. Johnson. He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
not at home, and the two, left together in the autocrat’s
sanctum, disported themselves in mock
humour. Hannah approached his great chair, and
sat pompously in it, hoping to catch some of his genius.
Can you not hear Johnson’s laughter as he
bluntly told her, when he was informed of the incident,
that he rarely sat in that particular chair?</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld was no less clever than Hannah
More in the handling of witty verse; in fact, the latter
was ever ready with her gifts in the drawing-room,
and added generously her share to the circle gathered
around the actor, David Garrick. He it was who
had sufficient faith in Miss More’s dramatic ability
to present two of her plays. Even at that time she
had a reputation among her associates for being
very strict in her religious observances; for one evening,
it being Sunday, and Garrick not averse to
piano-playing, he turned to “Nine,” as he called her,
thus indicating that she was a favoured one among the
muses, and told her to leave the room, promising to
call her back when the music was over.</p>

<p>Hannah More’s social work is to be considered
from the year (1789) that Mr. Wilberforce, one of
her close friends, discovered the deplorable conditions
existing in the districts around Cheddarcliff.
Her long intercourse with the Garricks, and her
various literary endeavours which took form during
1782 in her “Sacred Dramas” for the young, have
no direct bearing upon her connection with the religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
movement which places her in the general
scheme with Robert Raikes and Mrs. Trimmer.
Patty More had had, at an earlier period, large experience
in school-teaching, and this was to prove of
inestimable service, for it was with her assistance
that Hannah carried on the work in the Mendip
mining districts. The two met with some opposition,
not only from the classes for whom they were
specially striving, but from those who, less broad
than themselves, held views regarding the Sunday-school
that placed spirituality above the actual needs
of the poverty-stricken communities. But, throughout,
the Mores never swerved from their set purpose,
even though illness overtook them and made the
situation still harder than it was. For they were
forced to ride many miles from their home, at first
unknown in the region they had elected to benefit, a
region cursed by ignorance, plagued by license, and
wherein assault was a common incident.</p>

<p>“Miss Wilberforce would have been shocked,”
writes Hannah More, “could she have seen the petty
tyrants whose insolence we stroked, the ugly children
we fondled, the pointers and spaniels we caressed,
the cider we commended, and the wine we swallowed.”</p>

<p>A study of the centres established by these sisters,
and which gradually exerted an influence over
twenty-eight miles of territory, a distance traversed
in a manner not unlike the journey of the circuit-riders
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
who are to be met with throughout the mountain
districts of the South, would throw considerable
light on English labour conditions as they then existed.
The setting is an isolated wild land, thus
described by Miss More:</p>

<p>“Several of the grown-up youths had been tried
at the last assizes; three were the children of a
person lately condemned to be hanged; many
thieves,—all ignorant, profane, and vicious beyond
belief. Of this banditti, we have enlisted 170; and
when the clergyman, a hard man, who is also the
magistrate, saw these creatures kneeling around us,
whom he had seldom seen but to commit, or punish
in some way, he burst into tears.”</p>

<p>The work grew with the months, and mention is
soon made of nine hundred children flocking to a
Mendip feast—little ones whose brightest moments
were centred in the regular visits of these ministering
ladies.</p>

<p>Miss More’s powers were exerted toward counteracting
the ideas being spread by the French
Revolution; both high and low were struggling
against them; they nearly swamped the genius of
Wordsworth. Though she rejoiced in the fall of the
Bastille, she deplored the deification of Nature and
the reign of Reason, and vented her sarcasm on the
philosophy of Paine. Her chief alarm was felt for
the effect such opinions might have upon the middle
class of England. But, despite her conservatism,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Miss More was regarded as too strong-minded for
religious work; the High Church accused her of
too marked an independence. She was advised,
much to her own amusement, to publish a confession
of her faith. The discussion which ensued
need not occupy us; it may, perhaps, have infused
into her juvenile tracts a more determined tone, but
it did not originally encourage her in their composition.</p>

<p>This was brought about through a desire to give
the children of the poor districts religious literature
as soon as they were able to read. Mrs. Trimmer
was the only author then available, and her books
were too expensive for the masses. The More sisters,
therefore, soliciting the interest of the Duke of
Gloucester, brother of George III, began the publication
of the tracts, three a month, containing short
talks, ballads, and moral tales. These were scattered
broadcast over the country. The scheme lasted
from 1794 to 1797, when they were forced to discontinue
it, for lack of pecuniary backing. But, during
the time, collections of “Repository Tracts” had
been brought into existence, which, for at least a
quarter of a century, were to stand representative of
the best kind of reading for the poor.</p>

<p>A long list of books comprises the literary activity
of Hannah More,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> 
but it is by such volumes as her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
“Christian Morals,” “Hints toward Forming the
Character of a Young Princess [Charlotte, Princess
of Wales],” “Practical Piety,” “The Spirit of
Prayer,” “Strictures on the Modern System of
Female Education,” and “Thoughts on the Importance
of Manners” that her genuine art is overclouded.
In her “Repository Tracts,” she was
content to approach the poor as a class, nor was she
willing to allow herself to forget for an instant that,
because of their poverty, they were a type of inferior
being. Her object was to make them content with
their lot in life, and to have them feel comfortable
and worthy within their particular sphere. They
were potential with the strength that might place
them at the head of their class, but could not carry
them outside of it. An insurmountable barrier was
thought to stretch between the high and low.</p>

<p>“The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” is considered
the most famous of Miss More’s tracts. They all
are redolent with the common moral ideal, but the
local colour in them is real and the glimpses of the
poor people, their homes, customs, beliefs, hopes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
and despairs are described with minute vividness and
with much feeling. Whatever brightness they contain
is the sort that is gained by way of contrast,—an
ethical resolve to show that things are not so bad
that they may not still be worse. “Father,” says
the little girl, “I wish I was big enough to say grace.
I am sure I would say it heartily to-day; for I was
thinking what <em>poor</em> people do who have no salt to
their potatoes.”</p>

<p>The standard is a narrow one; the child who does
not go to church is the bad child; the lack of a new
gown fades before the delights over owning a new
Bible. Instead of marking books, as the Edgeworths
advised, Miss More italicised the passages
worthy of memorising. Honest toil is the subject-matter
of these stories; the village is the scene of
many a vexation. The gaining of knowledge is only
a means toward a better understanding of the catechism;
one’s duty is to learn to read, else the Holy
Writ is a closed subject. There is no aim to carry
the children outside of themselves by means of the
highest imagination; they are told how they are
to cope with their own environment, how to remain
satisfied with their own station. They must be
rich Christians, but still remain poor people.</p>

<p>Although Walpole retracted some of the harsh
censure which he at first heaped upon Hannah
More, he was not far wrong in his condemnation
of her “ill-natured strictures.” The person who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
does not recognise a tendency, in all this literature,
“to protract the imbecility of childhood,” “to arrest
the understanding instead of advancing it,” “to
give forwardness without strength” has failed to
understand the true function of a child’s book—to
afford the nursery a good time, is the way Mr. Lucas
expresses it.</p>

<p>Was there not something in this religious one-sidedness
to belittle the true dignity of the spirit?<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Heaven lies about us in our infancy, and we find
ourselves in a beautiful land of promise; we are
placed therein to face the years; by experience, by
training, by guidance along the lines of our own
natures, we are prepared to understand something of
the character of the way we shall have to tread
alone. We should be made to face the future, but
not to discount the present. We find ourselves
defined by circumstances, but we need not remain
slaves to them. To stigmatise a class in literature is
to stigmatise a reader. Miss More and her contemporaries
never questioned their social attitude—whether
it was just or broad or transitory. Full of
the pioneer work which they were doing, they did
not recognise the right for the poor which was already
the right for the rich. Juvenile literature was
not for the heart of all youth, but for the benefaction
of this one and of that. And while the educational
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
idea broadened and was to advance with the scientific
spirit on the one hand, on the other, it had
narrowed and was destined for a long, monotonous
struggle with the conscious Sunday-school tale.
This character of story was flat and void, and, because
removed from the reality of nature, it was
robbed of the inherent spirit of truth. It identified
religion with literary meekness.</p>


<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">The Poets: Watts; Jane and Ann Taylor;
William Blake.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Everything depends on the reality of a poet’s classic
character. If he is a dubious classic, let us sift him; if he
is a false classic, let us explode him. But if he is a real
classic, if his work belongs to the class of the very best (for
this is the true and right meaning of the word</i> classic, classical),
<i>then the great thing for us is to feel and enjoy his
work as deeply as ever we can, and to appreciate the wide
difference between it and all work which has not the same
high character. This is what is salutary, this is what is
formative; this is the great benefit to be got from the study
of poetry. Everything which interferes with it, which hinders
it, is injurious.</i>—<i>Matthew Arnold</i>, in “The Study of
Poetry.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have progressed sufficiently in our outline to
begin showing the links that bind the past with the
present. To dwell upon more writers of the generation
just treated is simply to repeat the same essential
characteristics of the type. These authors all used
the medium of prose in their desire to give young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
people books suitable to their comprehension. But
there were a few poets who braved the intricacies
of verse, and who wrote some very simple and pleasing
lyrics, which have survived the change in spirit,
and form some of the most agreeable pages in our
children’s anthologies. It will be recollected that
Mrs. Barbauld feared poetry would not be understood,
and so she wrote her volume of prose pieces
which acted as a substitute.</p>

<p>Wordsworth himself could not have demanded a
more careful attention to the simplicity of word
selection than that paid by Dr. Isaac Watts (1674–1748),
who, though not first in the field of hymn-writers,
for his immediate predecessor was Bishop
Thomas Ken<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> (1637–1711), author of “Morning
and Daily Hymns,” was nevertheless one of the
very first consciously to pen a book of verse for a
juvenile public.</p>

<p>Not only was he actively engaged in the interests
of education, but, during his famous thirty-six years’
spent as visitor in the household of Sir Thomas
Abney, of Newington, he crystallised his ideas on
education, and incorporated them in his “The
Improvement of the Mind: To which is added A
Discourse on the Education of Children and Youth.”</p>

<p>This treatise may be regarded as a fair example of
the pre-Rousseau style of pedagogy. The child was
measured in terms of sectarian standards, it being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
assumed that the first step was to impress him with the
truth that his very nature was sinful, and that it could
be shrived only by having the mind centred always
upon holy thoughts. The religion of the closet
must be held above every pleasure. Yet Dr. Watts
notices that such pleasures are increasing to an
alarming state; that children are rebelling against
Puritan principles. His sternness relents, in so far
as he would allow children to play draughts and
chess, and to amuse themselves with games which
might instruct them in the rudiments of grammar
and geometry.</p>

<p>Though there are not many who would discountenance
his diatribe against the gaming table, the
dangers besetting midnight revellers, and the freedom
which results in immorality, one cannot but view
with distrust the strictures which would turn girls
into dowdy creatures and boys into prigs. The
theoretical predecessors of Rousseau’s Émile were
the two creations of Dr. Watts,—Eugenio and
Phronissa—his ideal children, combining those
qualities which rob youth of all charm. Theirs
must have been wearisome lives. The boy, we are
told, “is an entertaining companion to the gay young
gentlemen, his equals; and yet divines and philosophers
take pleasure to have Eugenio amongst
them.” Dr. Watts never deigned to tell us what
requirements Eugenio set for the staid divines, or
whether he tried to get away from them. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
Phronissa: she stands before us now, in attitude betokening
detestation of the stage, and we hear her
proclaiming the song and the dance as her meanest
pleasures—talents not to be proud of!</p>

<p>Two points are worthy of note in <span id='cor_122'>Dr. Watts’s</span>
book. Despite his many limitations which argued
for piousness and for the composure of the youthful
spirit; despite his disapproval of all exercise which
might turn one’s thoughts away from the prescribed
paths, he was nevertheless a pleader in the cause of
advance. For what he lays down as educational
theory he would have parents hearken to; in his
eyes the bringing up of youth is a sacred duty, involving
obligations of a delicate nature. He would
emphasise the responsibility of the Home; he would
have parents eager to see the moral laws obeyed by
their children. He would have education applied
equally as well to girls as to boys; in fact, so Dr.
Watts confesses, in tones as though he were making
a great concession, the habit of reading is quite as
important to the former as to the latter.</p>

<p>Dark as the days may seem in the lives of those
children educated according to theories and tracts,
the lighter recreations must have brightened moments
unrecorded. Even John Locke (1632–1704),
in his “Thoughts on Education” (1693), recommends
besides the Psalter and the New Testament,
Æsop and Reynard the Fox, as good food for infant
minds. This was an excellent basis to start upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>The two small volumes of “Divine Songs, Attempted
in Easy Language for the Use of Children” [editions,
New York: Mahlon Day; Cambridge: 1803]
which I have examined, bear upon the fly-leaves tales
recorded in uncertain handwriting. The one has,
“To ——, a present from his Mamma”; the other,
“—— his Book: If this should be lost and you
should <em>fine</em>, Return to me, for it is <em>mine</em>.”</p>

<p>“You will find here nothing that savours of
party,” says the poet in his foreword. “... As I
have endeavoured to sink the language to the level
of a child’s understanding, and yet to keep it, if
possible, above contempt, so I have designed to
profit all, if possible, and to offend none.”</p>

<p>Yet the usual theological doctrines reek from every
page; there is much of the tenor of the “New England
Primer” in the verses. The wonder is that with all
their atmosphere of brimstone and sulphur, with
all their effort to present <em>to</em> the child grown-up
beliefs in simple doses, the poems still retain a spontaneity,
a sweet, quaint simplicity that strike the
sympathy, if they do not entirely appeal to the fancy.
“His dreadful Majesty” is more suited to Milton
than to a song; “How doth the little busy bee,”
though not yet in accord with the lyrist’s pure, unfeigned
delight in nature, is overtopping in childish
appeal, “The eternal God will not disdain, To
hear an infant cry.” We pit an understanding of
childhood’s graces against that old-time theory of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
inherited ruin. There has been a revulsion of
feeling which tends to bring the heart much nearer
the soul, and to give to the nursery the sanctified love
of good rather than the abiding fear of evil.</p>

<p>There is a picture in Lamb’s “Books for Children”
[ed. E. V. Lucas], showing the ark with the animals
in their symmetrically built stalls. The clouds are
rolling over the waters with as much substantial
outline as though they were balls of cotton; there is
interest for a child in the close examination of this
graphic art, which is done with that surety as though
the artist had been on the spot. The reproduction
was made from Stackhouse’s Bible, with which Mrs.
Trimmer used to amuse her young folks on Sundays.
Your wooden Noah’s Ark, with the sticky animals,
was built along the same lines. Dr. Watts’s poems
have been illustrated many times in similar conventional
fashion. One cut in particular represented
creation by a dreadful lion and a marvellous tiger,
anatomically wonderful.</p>

<p>Though parts of the Bible have been paraphrased
by Dr. Watts as well as such can ever be done;
though ducks and lambs and doves, symbols of
simplicity, take one to the open, there is no breath
of clover sweeping across the page. It is by such
a beautiful cradle hymn as “Holy angels guard thy
bed,” which is to be treasured with Martin Luther’s
exquisite “Hymn to the Christ Child,” that this poet
deserves to be remembered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Always the truest verse, the truest sentiment, the
truest regard for children are detected in that retrospective
tone—the eternal note of sadness, as Matthew
Arnold phrases it—in which grown people speak
of the realm of youth lost to them; not the sentimental
stooping, not the condescending superiority,—but
a yearning note brought about by the
tragedy of growing up,—a yearning that passeth
understanding, and that returns with every flash of
the remembered child you were.</p>

<p>The Taylors of Ongar, the two sisters, Ann (1782–1866)
and Jane (1783–1824), are the poets of the
didactic era; they apply to verse the same characteristics
Miss More introduced in her tracts—a
sympathetic feeling, but a false tenderness. They
are not doctrinal in their “Original Poems for
Infant Minds,” but are generally and genuinely
ethical. Their attitude is different from
that of Watts; they attempt to interpret feelings
and impressions in terms of the child’s own comprehension.
But so far were they ruled by the
customary requirements of their time, that they
falsely endowed the juvenile mind with the power
of correlating external beauty with its own virtuous
possibilities. The simplicity of Jane’s “The Violet”
and “Thank you, Pretty Cow” is marked by an
unnatural discrimination on the part of the children
from whom such sentiments are supposed to flow;
these defects detract from many a delicate verse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
deserving of better acquaintance than “Twinkle,
twinkle, little star.”</p>

<p>The Taylors wrote together for a number of years;
they opened a field of interest in and kindness to
animals; their verse abounds in the beginnings of a
spontaneous love of nature. Their children troop
past us, the industrious boy and the idle boy, the
rich and the poor. They are not active children;
their positions are fixed ones of contemplation, of
inward communing, not of participation. Yet the
sweet spirit predominates, and the simple words are
not robbed of their purity and strength. However,
their desire “to abridge every poetic freedom and
figure” dragged them often into absurdities. This
is the great danger in writing simple verse; unless
its excellence is dominant, it shows its weakness;
the outline of lyric beauty must have perfect symmetry;
the slightest falsity in imagery, the slightest
departure from consistency and truth, destroys the
whole.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Jane, when she was very small, used to edify her
neighbours by preaching to them; this impulse
found expression later in a series of hymns. Ann
also composed religious songs which in quality are
superior to those of her sister. The literary association
of the two lasted until 1812, when Ann was
sought in marriage by a Mr. Gilbert; this negotiation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
was consummated by letter before they had even
met.</p>

<p>A further advance in the art of children’s verse
was made when William Blake (1757–1827) wrote
his “Songs of Innocence,” and infused into them a
light spirit of grace and of joy. Strangely, he had
difficulty in disposing of his poems; on this account,
he determined to prepare the plates for them himself.
The drawings which resulted proved to be some of
his very best art work. Through his acquaintance
with Godwin, he was employed to illustrate many of
the books issuing from Mrs. Godwin’s publishing
house, and it has not yet been fully settled whether
or not he made the original illustrations for the
Lambs’ “Tales from Shakespeare.” He was employed
to engrave the plates for Mary Wollstonecraft’s
translation of Salzmann’s “Elements of
Morality.”</p>

<p>We detect in Blake’s verses the apt blending
of grown-up regard for childhood, with the ready
response of childhood to grown-up love. By his
exuberance, by his fancy, by his simple treatment
he set a standard which is the same that dominates
the best of Wordsworth and Christina Rossetti.
Stevenson later carried forward the art, by adding
thereto a touch as though youth, fearful of growing
up, knew something of the heavy burden of man’s
estate. Thus does Blake express infant joy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have no name:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am but two days old.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What shall I call thee?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“I happy am,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Joy is my name.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweet joy befall thee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class='no-indent'>The crystal clearness in such sentiment is born of
our adult reverence. Again he makes the nurse in
one of his poems sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then come home, my children, the sun is going down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the dews of night arise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, come, leave off play, and let us away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the morning appears in the skies.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class='no-indent'>A child appreciates such mellow tones; there is no
reaching down; the picture is distinct, reduced to its
truest sentiment. It contains traceries of action, and
fairest hints of beneficent nature. It gives a promise
of to-morrow. There is no herding into the land
of sleep. Let <em>us</em> away! Do you not feel the distinction
of dignity in it, rather than “get <em>you</em> to bed”?</p>

<p>In Stevenson’s verse the dominant note is retrospective;
he returns to childhood with his quota of
world experience; he slips into the youthful state,
glad of being there once more, yet knowing what it
all means to have to leave it again. Night fears and
day joys flow through his lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span id='cor_128'>Away down the river,</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A hundred miles or more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Other little children</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shall bring my boats ashore.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>
<p class='no-indent'>There is the preternatural strain of sadness in the
make-up of youth; they like to discover in their
elders those same characteristics they possess; they
will creep to the strong arm of him who marvels as
they do at the mystery of silent things. Such a one,
even though grown-up, is worth while; he knows
what it is to be in bed in summer with “the birds
still hopping on the grass”; he knows what it is to
be a child. Stevenson, the man, becomes the remembered
boy.</p>

<p>The poetry for children that has lived is of that
quality which appeals to the pristine sense of all
that is fair and good and <span id='cor_129'>beautiful</span>. Tender love,
unfettered joy, protecting gentleness recognise no
age; we, who are no longer young, look through the
barred gates and up the gravel road, flanked by the
dense freshness of green. Somewhere we hear the
splash of water, far off we see the intense white of
marble. Clinging to the iron bars outside, we
watch the girl and boy, we count their footprints in
the sand. They stoop to pick the violets as we
stooped years ago; they look into the basin of clear
water as we looked years ago. And then the path
curves out of view. Here is where our appreciative
contemplation of childhood becomes self-conscious;
we cannot <em>see</em> the little ones doing what we did in
years gone by. Perhaps this, perhaps that; we
have our first <em>moral</em> doubt. Through the bars we
call to the childhood of our memory; we call it to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
come back. The poet has but to sing of what he
found beyond that bend when he was young, of the
child he was, who once looked up at him from the
clear depths; the boy and girl will creep down
the gravel path again, they will marvel at what is
told them of revolving suns, of the lost childhood,
of the flight of birds, and of the shiver of grass. Let
the poet but sing in true notes, making appeal to
their imagery, giving them vigour in exchange for
their responsiveness, and understanding in exchange
for their trust; they will return, even to the iron gate,
and take him by the hand. This is what it means
to be the laureate of childhood.</p>


<h3>V. <span class="smcap">Charles and Mary Lamb; The Godwins.</span></h3>

<p>A story is told of Charles Lamb which, in view of
actual facts, one must necessarily disbelieve. It is
to the effect that, dining out one evening, he heard
in an adjoining room the noise of many children.
With his glass filled, he rose from his chair and
drank the toast, “Here’s to the health of good King
Herod.” Instinctively, those familiar with Elia
will recollect his “Dream Children,” and wonder
how any critic could reconcile the two attitudes.
Lamb had an abiding love for young people and a
keen understanding of their natures.</p>

<p>As writers of juvenile literature, Charles (1775–1834)
and Mary (1765–1847) Lamb might never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
have been known, had it not been for William Godwin
(1756–1836) and his second wife. The two
began a publishing business, in 1805, under the firm
name of M. J. Godwin and Company. The only
details that concern us are those which began and
ended with the Lambs and their work. Godwin,
himself, under the pseudonym of Baldwin, turned
out literary productions of various kinds. But
though, during one period, there was every sign of a
flourishing trade, by 1822 the business was bankrupt.</p>

<p>The Lambs regarded their writings for children
as pot-boilers; letters from them abound with such
confessions. But it was in their natures to treat their
work lovingly; their own personalities entered the
text; they drew generously upon themselves; and so
their children’s books are filled with their own experiences,
and are, in many respects, as autobiographical
as the “Essays of Elia.” Mary undertook
by far the larger number of the volumes which are
usually accredited to her brother; in fact, wherever the
two collaborated, Lamb occupied a secondary place.</p>

<p>The following list indicates the division of labour:</p>

<p class='bib p1'><span class="smcap">The King and Queen of Hearts</span>, 1805. Lamb’s first
juvenile work.</p>

<p class='bib ph'><span class="smcap">Tales from Shakespeare</span>, 1807. Lamb wrote to
Manning, May 10, 1806: “I have done ‘Othello’ and
‘Macbeth,’ and mean to do all the tragedies. I think
it will be popular among the little people, besides
money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p class='bib ph'><span class="smcap">Adventures of Ulysses</span>, 1808. “Intended,” as Lamb
told Manning, “to be an introduction to the reading
of Telemachus; it is done out of the ‘Odyssey,’
not from the Greek. I would not mislead you; nor
yet from Pope’s ‘Odyssey,’ but from an older translation
of one Chapman. The ‘Shakespeare Tales’ suggested
doing it.” Lamb’s delight in Chapman was
as unalloyed as that of Keats.</p>

<p class='bib ph'><span class="smcap">Mrs. Leicester’s School</span>, 1809. Issued anonymously,
hence commonly ascribed to Lamb. The greater part
of the work belongs to Mary; it seems to have been her
idea originally. Lamb to Barton, January 23, 1824:
“My Sister’s part in the Leicester School (about two-thirds)
was purely her own; as it was (to the same
quantity) in the Shakespeare Tales which bear my name.
I wrote only the Witch Aunt, the First Going to
Church, and the final story about a little Indian Girl in
a Ship.”</p>

<p class='bib ph'><span class="smcap">Poetry for Children</span>, 1809. Lamb claimed about
one-third of the book as his own. Mr. Lucas believes
that Mrs. Godwin issued these verses to compete
with the Taylors and Adelaide O’Keeffe.</p>

1811. Robinson wrote: “I this year tried to persuade
him [Lamb] to make a new version of the old Tale of
Reynard the Fox. He said he was sure it would not
succeed—sense for humour, said L., is extinct.” “Prince
Dorus” was done instead.</p>

<p class='bib ph'><span class="smcap">Beauty and the Beast</span>, 1811. Authorship doubtful.</p>

<p class='p1'>There is something keenly pathetic in noting the
brother and sister at work in the interests of children,
hoping to add to their yearly income—sitting down
together and thinking out conceptions for their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
juvenile poems and stories. Mary Lamb reveals, by
those smaller elements in her prose, a keener discernment
of what a child’s book should be; she is far
more successful than her brother in entering into
the spirit of the little lives she writes about, while
Lamb himself is happiest in his touches where he
is handling the literary subjects.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But on the
whole, Lamb’s style was not suited to the making
of children’s books. We see them, while writing
the Shakespeare Tales, seated at one table, “an
old literary Darby and Joan,” Mary tells Sarah
Stoddart, “I taking snuff and he groaning all the
while, and saying he can make nothing of it, which
he always says till he has finished, and then he finds
out he has made something of it....”</p>

<p>Mrs. Godwin doubtless conceived her system of
advertising direct from Newbery; in the story of
“Emily Barton,” which forms part of “Mrs. Leicester’s
School,” Mary Lamb tells how Emily’s papa
ordered the coachman to drive to the Juvenile
Library in Skinner street [No. 41], where seven
books were bought, “and the lady in the shop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
persuaded him to take more, but mamma said that
was quite enough at present.”</p>

<p>By this, the Lambs indicated a willingness to
accord with any business suggestions which might
further the interests of the Godwins; nevertheless,
they were not so bound that they could not act independently.
And, in view of the fact that Lamb
disliked Mrs. Godwin, there was a certain graciousness
revealed in the concessions they did make from
time to time. Elia was to discover that Godwin had
his eye alert for any unnecessary element of cruelty
which might creep into their books for children.
When the publishers were given the manuscript of
“Ulysses,” Godwin wrote a letter to Lamb, on March
10, 1808, which, with the answer, is worth quoting,
since the attitude is one to be considered by all
writers and by all library custodians.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class='no-indent p1'><span class="smcap">Dear Lamb</span>:</p>

<p>I address you with all humility, because I know you to
be <i lang='la'>tenax propositi</i>. Hear me, I entreat you, with patience.</p>

<p>It is strange with what different feelings an author and
a bookseller look at the same manuscript. I know this
by experience: I was an author, I am a bookseller. The
author thinks what will conduce to his honour; the bookseller,
what will cause his commodities to sell.</p>

<p>You, or some other wise man, I have heard to say [it was
Johnson]: It is children that read children’s books, when
they are read, but it is parents that choose them. The
critical thought of the tradesman puts itself therefore into
the place of the parent, and what the parent will condemn.</p>

<p>We live in squeamish days. Amid the beauties of your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
manuscript, of which no man can think more highly than
I do, what will the squeamish say to such expressions as
these, ‘devoured their limbs, yet warm and trembling,
lapping the blood,’ page 10. Or to the giant’s vomit,
page 14, or to the minute and shocking description of the
extinguishing the giant’s eye in the page following. You,
I dare say, have no formed plan of excluding the female
sex from among your readers, and I, as a bookseller, must
consider that, if you have, you exclude one half of the
human species.</p>

<p>Nothing is more easy than to modify these things if you
please, and nothing, I think, is more indispensable....</p>
</div>

<p class='p1'>The main argument here stated daily confronts
the librarian and the author; it is one so often over-considered,
that in its wake it leaves a diluted literature,
mild in expression, faint in impression, weak in
situation, and lacking in colour. There is a certain
literary style that, through zealous regard for refinement,
misses the rugged vitality which marks the
old-time story, and which constitutes its chief hold
upon life. On the other hand, children need very
little stimulation, provided it is virile, to set them in
active accord; and it is wise for publishers to consider
the omissions of those unnecessary details,
situations, or actions, without which the story is in
no way harmed. But to curtail or to dilute the full
meaning, to give a part for the whole, has resulted in
producing so many versions of the same tale or legend
as to make the young reader doubt which is the
correct one; and in most cases leave in him no desire
to turn to the original source. On your library
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
shelves, are you to have five or six versions of the
same story, issued by as many rival publishing
houses, or are you to discard them all and take only
that one which is <em>nearest</em> the original in spirit and
in general excellence?</p>

<p>Lamb here brushed against the problem of writing
for the popular taste. This is how he met it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right p1">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">March 11, 1808.</span></span><br>
</p>

<p class='no-indent'><span class="smcap">Dear Godwin</span>:</p>

<p>The giant’s vomit was perfectly nauseous, and I am
glad you pointed it out. I have removed the objection.
To the other passages I can find no objection but what
you may bring to numberless passages besides, such as of
Scylla snatching up the six men, etc.,—that is to say, they
are lively images of <em>shocking</em> things. If you want a book
which is not occasionally to <em>shock</em>, you should not have
thought of a tale which is so full of anthropophagi and
wonders. I cannot alter these things without enervating
the Book, and I will not alter them if the penalty should be
that you and all the London booksellers should refuse it.
But speaking as author to author, I must say that I think
<em>the terrible</em> in those two passages seems to me so much to
preponderate over the nauseous as to make them rather
fine than disgusting. [Remember, this is spoken by one
who in youth was sensitive and whose feelings are <span id='cor_136'>graphically</span>
set forth in “Witches, and Other Night Fears.”]...
I only say that I will not consent to alter such passages,
which I know to be some of the best in the book. As an
author, I say to you, an author, Touch not my work. As to
a bookseller I say, Take the work, such as it is, or refuse
it. You are free to refuse it as when we first talked of it.
As to a friend I say, Don’t plague yourself and me with
nonsensical objections. I assure you I will not alter one
more word.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p class='p1'>Lamb’s critical genius often showed remarkable
subtlety in the fine distinctions drawn between
shades of effect which are produced by art. He
established, through his careful analyses, an almost
new critical attitude toward Shakespeare; and, in
days when psychology as a study was unknown,
when people witnessed the different phases of
emotional life and judged them before formulæ were
invented by which to test them scientifically, he saw,
with rare discrimination, the part that the spiritual
value of literature was to play in the development of
culture. He here weighs in the balance a fine terror
with a nauseous scene; such a difference presupposes
a clear insight into the story and a power to arrive
at the full meaning at once; it infers an instinctive
knowledge of the whole gamut of possible effects.
Lamb’s plea to Godwin is the plea of the man who
would rather keep a child in the green fields than
have him spend his time on wishy-washy matter.</p>

<p>The whole discussion resolves itself into the
question: How much of the brute element, in which
early literature abounds, is to be given to children?
Shall they be made to fear unnecessarily, shall the
ugly phases of life be allowed, simply because they
come through the ages stamped as classic? All due
consideration must be paid to the sensitiveness of
childhood; but in what manner? Not by catering to
it, not by eliminating the cause from the story without
at the same time seeking to strengthen the inherent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
weakness of the child. Dr. Felix Adler<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> would
remove from our folk-lore all the excrescences that
denote a false superstition and that create prejudice
of any kind; he would have bad stepmothers taken
from the fairy tales, because an unjust hatred for a
class is encouraged; he would prune away whatever
is of no ornamental or ethical value. Assuredly it
is best, as Dr. Adler points out, “to eliminate ...
whatever is merely a relic of ancient animism.” Mr.
Howells believes that it is our pedant pride which
perpetuates the beast man in our classics, and it is
true that some of our literature has lived in spite of
that characteristic, and not because of it. But who
is to point this beast man out for us, who is to judge
whether this or that corrupts, who to eliminate and
who to recreate? The classics would have to be
rewritten whenever there was a shift in moral viewpoint.</p>

<p>A mushroom growth of story-writers, those who
“tame” our fairy tales, who dilute fancy with sentimentalism,
and who retell badly what has been told
surpassing well, threatens to choke the flower. It
is not the beast man in classic literature we have to
fear so much as the small man of letters, enthused by
the educational idea, who rewrites to order, and does
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
not put into his text any of the invigorating spirit
which marks all truly great literature. We have
always to return to the ultimate goal, to the final
court of appeal. If there is too much brutal strength
in a story intended for children, it had best be read
or told to them, rather than place in their hands what
is not literature but the mere husk.</p>

<p>Such a letter as Lamb wrote to Godwin leads us
to feel that at times misgivings seized him as to his
own mutilation of Homer and of his much-beloved
Chapman. But such hesitancy is the exception and
not the rule to-day.</p>

<p>As poets for children the Lambs strike their most
artificial note; the verses are forced and written
according to prescribed formulæ. There is a mechanical
effort in them to appear youthful, as though before
setting to the task—for so the two called it—a memorandum
of childish deeds and thoughts and expressions
had been drawn up, from which each was to
extract inspiration. But inspiration is sorely lacking;
to most of the poems you can apply the stigma of
“old maids” children; there is little that is naturally
playful or spontaneously appealing in sentiment. Such
lines as “Crumbs to the Birds” are unaffected and
simple, and the paraphrase “On the Lord’s Prayer”
aptly interpretative. But on the whole, the verses
are stilted; the feeling in them comes not from the
authors so much as it indicates how carefully it was
thought out by them. We find Lamb making excuses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
to Coleridge in June, 1809: “Our little poems
are ... humble, but they have no name. You
must read them, remembering they were task-work;
and perhaps you will admire the number of subjects,
all of children, picked out by an old bachelor and
an old maid. Many parents would not have found
so many.”</p>

<p>It is this utmost sincerity and such a naïve confession
which make Charles Lamb one of the most
lovable figures in English literature.</p>

Children,” written by the Reverend Christian Gotthilf Salzmann
(1744–1811), who won no small renown for the excellence of his
school, founded upon the principles set down by Rousseau. “The
design of this book,” says the worthy master, “is to give birth to
what we call a good disposition in children.” The chief delight
of the 1782 edition, published in three volumes, are the copperplates
which represent in the most graphic way, by pose, gesture,
expression, and caption, all the ills that juvenile flesh is heir to.
No one, after having once viewed the poor little figure seated on a
most forbidding-looking sofa, can quite resist the pangs of sympathy
over his exclamation: “How sad is life without a friend!” Life
is indeed a direful wilderness of trials and vexations. The prismatic
colors of one’s years shrivel up before such wickedness as
is expressed by the picture “I hate you!” And yet how simple is
the remedy for a boy’s bad disposition, according to the Reverend
Mr. Salzmann! “Teach him,” so the philosopher argues in his
preface, “that envy is the vexation which is felt at seeing the happiness
of others: you will have given him a just idea of it; but
shew him its dreadful effects, in the example of Hannah in chap.

thus comparatively young at the time of her death. A glimpse
of Miss More at seventy-nine is left in the reminiscences of the
original Peter Parley, who visited her, <i lang='la'>circa</i> 1823, much as a
devout pilgrim would make a special journey. He wrote: “She
was small and wasted away. Her attire was of dark-red bombazine,
made loose like a dressing-gown. Her eyes were black and
penetrating, her face glowing with cheerfulness, through a lace-work
of wrinkles. Her head-dress was a modification of the
coiffure of her earlier days—the hair being slightly frizzled, and
lightly powdered, yet the whole group of moderate dimensions.”</p>

freed from the idea that situations could be dealt
with, apart from any overbearing <i lang='fr'>morale</i>, and even

problem of giving information—of teaching instead
of preaching.</p>

<p>The interest in external nature, the desire to explain
phenomena according to the dictates of belief,
infused a new element into authorship for young
people. But those writers brought to meet this
latent stirring of the scientific spirit all the harness
of the old régime. First they thought that they
could explain the evident by parables, but they found
that fact was too particular for generalisations, and
the child mind too immature for such symbol. Then
they attempted to define natural objects from a
childish plane, making silly statements take the
place of truth. They soon became aware that their
simple style had to deal with a set of details that
could not be sentimentalised.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that a new impulse was
started; the national spirit began to move toward
a more democratic goal; the rank and file began to
look beyond the narrow hill and dale; women sought
wider spheres; the poor demanded constitutional
rights; energy began to stir from underneath. The
word <em>modern</em> was in every one’s mind. The old order
changeth, giving place to new. The child’s intellect
must be furnished with food for its growth; Rousseau’s
doctrine of “back to nature” was found not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
to have worked; it was realised that special training
must begin early for all the walks of life. Carlyle was
pleading for a <em>public</em> library, education was widening
its sphere.</p>

<p>In the preceding pages, we have tried to establish a
continuous line of development in children’s books
through several centuries; upon such a foundation the
English story and the American story of to-day are
based. The table of English writers on page 147
contains names of minor importance, but still forming
a part of the past history—foreshadowers of the
new era. For therein you will discover that juvenile
literature first begins to show signs of differing from
adult literature only in its power; that where
Macaulay tells the story of England in terms of
maturity, Miss Strickland, Lady Callcott, Miss
Tytler, and Miss Yonge adopt a descending scale.
Where children were wont to act in accord with the
catechism, they are now made to feel an interest in
their surroundings. Mrs. Marcet writes for them
“talks” on chemistry and political economy, Mrs.
Wakefield on botany and insects. The extension
of schools meant that literature must be supplied
those schools; writers were encouraged in the same
way that Miss More was prompted to produce her
“Repository Tracts.” Grammars and histories began
to flood the market, and in the wake of Scott’s
novels, taking into consideration the fact that books
were being written for the purpose of information, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
child’s historical story was a natural consequence.
Thus we discover the connection between “Waverley”
and Henty. The death-blow to fairy tales in England,
brought about by the didactic writers, resulted
in a deplorable lack of imaginative literature for
children, until a German influence, around 1840–1850,
began to take effect, and the Grimms’ Household
Tales afforded a new impulse.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Mrs. Gatty,
author of the famous “Parables of Nature,” deigned
to rejoice over the classic nonsense of Lewis Carroll.
The line of descent can be drawn from Perrault to
Grimm, from Grimm to Andrew Lang’s rainbow
series of folk-lore.</p>

<p>The table is intended to do no more than indicate
the gradual manner in which this break took effect.
The student who would treat the evolution fully will
find it necessary to place side by side with his discussion
of individual books for young people, a full
explanation of those social changes in English history
which are the chief causes of the changes in English
literature. Children’s books are subject to just
those modifications which take place in the beliefs,
the knowledge, and the aspirations of the adult person.
The difference between the two is one of intensity
and not of kind. The student will discover,
after a study of the development of the common school,
how and why the educational impulse dominated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
over all elements of pure imagination; how the retelling
craze, given a large literary sanction by such a
writer as Lamb, and so excellently upheld by Charles
Kingsley, lost caste when brought within compass
of the text-book. He will finally see how this educational
pest has overrun America to a far greater
extent than England, to the detriment of much
that is worthy and of much which should by rights
be made to constitute a children’s reading heritage.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The American Side.</span></h3>

<p>As for the American phase of the subject, we have
already indicated three stages by which the Colonial
or Revolutionary reader was given his “New England
Primer,” his “Mother Goose,” and his Thomas books
obtained directly from Newbery of England. The
whole intellectual activity was in the hands of the
clergy; even the governing body pretended to be
God-fearing men, and were prone to listen to the
dictates of the ministry. The austere demands of the
Puritan Sunday, more than anything else, caused
the writing of religious books, and so firm a hold
did the Sabbath <i lang='la'>genre</i> of literature take, that, in 1870,
it was still in full sway, and even now exists to a
limited extent. The history of education in America
for a long while has to do with denominational
schools, and teaching was largely left in the hands
of the clergy. So that we shall find our early writer
of “juveniles” either a man of the church, or his wife;
prompted solely by the desire to supply that character
of story which would fitly harmonise with the
sanctity of Sunday, rather than with the true excellence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
of all days. If, in the school, a book was
needed, it was far better to write one than to trust to
others for what might turn out to be heretical.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The
Rev. Jedidiah Morse began his literary career in
the capacity of teacher; Noah Webster’s idea was at
first to prepare a treatise on grammar which could be
used in the schools. These two were the most scientific
thinkers of their period. The list on page 158,
indicating but a few of the forgotten and only faintly
remembered authors of early days, fairly well represents
the general trend; in the writing done, there
were the same morals, the similar luckless children,
subject to the same thin sentiment of piety and rectitude
as we discovered holding sway in England for
nearly two centuries. The name of Peter Parley is
no longer familiar to children, and a crusade is fast
being formed against the Jacob Abbott class of book.
The type of writer was the kind that debated for or
against slavery in terms of the Bible. The Puritan
soil was rich for the rapid growth of the Hannah More
seed, and no one assisted in sowing it to greater extent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
than Samuel G. Goodrich (1793–1860). He
may symbolise for us the reading child in New England
at the beginning of the nineteenth century;
his training, his daily pursuits, as told in his autobiography,
supply pages of invaluable social colour.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>“It is difficult,” so he says, “... in this era
of literary affluence, almost amounting to surfeit, to
conceive of the poverty of books suited to children
in the days of which I write. Except the New
England Primer—the main contents of which were
the Westminster Catechism—and some rhymes,
embellished with hideous cuts of Adam’s Fall,
in which ‘we sinned all’; the apostle and a cock
crowing at his side, to show that ‘Peter denies his
Lord and cries’; Nebuchadnezzar crawling about
like a hog, the bristles sticking out of his back, and
the like—I remember none that were in general
use among my companions. When I was about ten
years old, my father brought from Hartford ‘Gaffer
Ginger,’ ‘Goody Two Shoes,’ and some of the rhymes
and jingles now collected under the name of ‘Mother
Goose,’ with perhaps a few other toy books of that
day. These were a revelation. Of course I read
them, but I must add, with no relish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>The confession follows that when he was given
“Red Riding Hood,” he was filled with contempt;
and in this spirit he condemns such nonsense as
“hie diddle diddle,” which is not fit for Christian
parents to use. He found some considerable pleasure
in “Robinson Crusoe,” but it was not until
he met with Miss Hannah More’s tracts that he
might be said to have enjoyed with relish any book
at all.</p>

<p>Thus his reading tastes foreshadowed his literary
activity. When he turned writer, he aimed for the
style which distinguishes Mary Howitt, Mrs. Hofland,
and Miss Strickland; he disclaimed any interest
in the nursery book that was unreasonable and untruthful,
for so he considered most of the stories of
fancy. In his books, his desire was chiefly “to feed
the young mind upon things wholesome and pure,
instead of things monstrous, false, and pestilent....
In short, that the element of nursery
books should consist of beauty instead of deformity,
goodness instead of wickedness, decency instead of
vulgarity.” In this manner, the mould of the Peter
Parley tales was shaped. Goodrich at first adopted
no philosophy of construction, so he says; he aimed to
tell his story as he would have spoken it to a group
of boys. But after a while, a strong sense of the
child’s gradual growth took hold of him; he recognised
psychological stages, and he saw that, as in
teaching, his books must consider that children’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
“first ideas are simple and single, and formed of
images of things palpable to the senses.”</p>

<p>While on a visit to England in 1823—the memorable
time he met Miss More—he turned his attention
to what was being accomplished there in popular
education for children. After investigation, he thus
wrote:</p>

<p>“Did not children love truth? If so, was it necessary
to feed them on fiction? Could not history,
natural history, geography, biography become the
elements of juvenile works, in place of fairies and
giants, and mere monsters of the imagination?
These were the inquiries that from this time filled
my mind.”</p>

<p>Under such conditions Peter Parley was born,
and reborn, and overborn; battles were waged for and
against him, just as they have only recently been
waged for and against the Elsie books. But no sooner
was Peter Parley identified with a definite person
than Mr. Goodrich’s trials began. He became a
victim of the imperfect copyright system; he found
his tales being pirated in England. And as fast as
he would settle one difficulty, another would arise;
spurious Parleys came to light, conflicting with his
sales. It was the case of Goodrich <i lang='la'>alias</i> Kettell,
<i lang='la'>alias</i> Mogridge, <i lang='la'>alias</i> Martin, and many more beside.
In fact, a writer, considering the life of William Martin
(1801–1867), quotes a statement to the effect
that “Messrs. Darton, Martin’s publishers, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
especial used to prefix the name [Peter Parley] to
all sorts of children’s books, without reference to
their actual authorship.”</p>

<p>Isaiah Thomas may be taken as representative of
our Revolutionary period, even as the “New England
Primer” may typify the chief literary product of our
Colonial life. Peter Parley marks for us the war
of 1812. It was after this that our country began
to expand, that the South and the Southwest unfolded
their possibilities, that the East began the
Westward move that led to the craze of ’49. The
Indian, the scout, the cowboy, the Yankee trader
have been the original contributions of America to
juvenile literature. A close study will indicate that
Cooper was the creator of this <i lang='la'>genre</i> of story,—more
painstaking, more effulgent, more detailed than the
Indian story-writer of to-day, but none the less a
permanent model. So, too, he will be found, in his
accounts of the navy, in his records of common seamen,
in his lives of naval officers, to be no mean, no
inaccurate, no dry historian; in fact, Cooper, as one
of our first naval critics, has yet to be accorded his
proper estimate.</p>

<p>American history, American development being
of a melodramatic character, it is natural that the
opposite to Sunday-school literature should rapidly
take root as soon as begun. A period of the
ten-cent novel flourished about 1860, when the
Beadle Brothers, who were finally to be merged into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
the publishing house of George Munro, began the
publication of their series of cheap volumes—the
sensationalism of Cooper raised to the <span class='math'>n</span>th power.
To-day there are men who glow with remembered
enthusiasm over Colonel Prentiss Ingraham and
the detective stories of A. W. Aiken—whose record
was often one a week—as they do over the name of
Hemyng <i lang='la'>alias</i> Jack Harkaway, or Mayne Reid,
with his traditional profanity. Edward S. Ellis (b.
1840) was one of the young members of this group of
writers. He became inoculated, but was forced,
when the milder process came into vogue, to soften
his high lights, and to accord with the times. What
such early “wild cat” literature did, however, for
present upholders of the “series” books, was to
exemplify that, by a given pattern, a tale could be
made to “go” to order. There was then, as there is
now, a certain type of book, neither moral nor immoral,
and not at all educational, but only momentarily
diverting; written without motive, without
definite object, but whose ground plan and mechanism
were workable.</p>

<p>The increase of the public-school system was the
chief opponent of the Sunday-school book, as it
likewise, by its educational emphasis, fought against
the dime-novel vogue. And with the inception of
the public school on its present large scale we reach
the immediate stage, the era of over-productivity,
with its enormous average taste, with its public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
regard for readers in the libraries, for scholars in
the class-rooms, for the poor in settlements, and for
the emigrant on the high seas.</p>

<p>After an experience of five years in reviewing
juvenile books of the past and in estimating the
varied stories of the present, I do not think it sweeping
to assert that while education has snatched the
child’s book from the moralist and taken away from
writing a false standard of right doing, it has not, as
yet, added any worthy attribute of itself. It has not
taught the child to judge good literature from the
bad; it has supplied, in a prescribed course, certain
isolated books or stereotyped poems, with which
the child is wearied in the class-room, and from
which, once outside, the child turns with natural
dread. I am judging solely from the standpoint of
juvenile taste. And so, with the entrance of a new
consideration—the children’s reading-rooms—it may
well be queried at the outset: What will this institution
add to the creative force? How far will
it seek to improve conditions? Will there be an increased
demand for the good and for the best books?
Will there be a more careful art manifested in the
writing of stories? Will the gaps in the field be
filled up? For an examination of the past and of the
present tells me that children’s literature, generally
speaking, has yet to be conquered.</p>

<p>With these remarks in view, the table that follows
may, on examination, bear some significance.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Present Situation.</span></h3>

<p>The essential difference between the past and the
present is not so much a difference, after all; in both
instances the same mistaken emphasis is placed upon
two separate phases of the child’s make-up. The
moral tale took no cognisance of those spiritual laws
which are above teaching, which act of themselves;
it did not recognise the existence of the child’s personality.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
But when the impetus toward the study,
scientific and intensive, of adolescence was begun,
the teacher lost sight of the free will by which
that growth advanced; anxious to prove the child’s
development to be but a series of stages marked by
educational gradings, he reserved no place for the
self-development through which the personality finds
expression. In both cases an unconscious injustice
was done juvenile nature. The moral questioning
warped the spirit, the educational questioning
chokes the imagination and fancy, starving the spirit
altogether. How many will agree with Emerson’s
assertion that “what we do not call education is
more precious than that which we call so”? The
pessimist who challenges children’s books for children
has reasons to doubt, after all.</p>

<p>Time changes not, ’tis we who change in time.
Emerson speaks in terms of evolution; by this very
change from generation to generation, the vitality
of a book is tested. Again, in terms of our mentality,
Emerson says that when a thought of Plato becomes a
thought to us, Time is no more. Truth is thus an
annihilator of the fleeting moment. The survival
of the fittest means the falling away of the mediocre.
The Sunday-school book was no permanent type;
its content was no classic expression. It filled a
timely demand—that was its excuse for being.
Once this demand became modified, the book’s
service was at an end; hence Mr. Welsh’s indication
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
of the decline of the Sunday-school story through
secularisation,—from sectarianism to broad religious
principles, thence to “example rather than direct
teaching.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>We still have the religious tract and the church story-paper;
yet the books of advice deal with the social
and ethical spirit, rather than with the denominational
stricture. “The less a man thinks or knows
about his virtues, the better we like him,” wrote
Emerson, while Stevenson, in his “Lay Sermons,”
placed the stress thus: “It is the business of life to
make excuses for others but not for ourselves.”</p>

<p>To-morrow new topics may be introduced into
our juvenile literature, but change takes longer than
a day to become apparent. The student who attempts
to reach any scientific estimate of the present
trend will be disappointed; the mass is too
conglomerate, and there are too many authors
writing children’s books for money rather than for
children. I have followed the course as carefully
as I could, noting the slight alterations in concepts
to accord with the varying conditions. But there
is no principle that can be deduced, other than the
educational one. The changes are confined to
points of external interest, not of spiritual or mental
significance. For instance, there was a time when
girls’ literature and boys’ literature were more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
clearly differentiated, one from the other; their near
approach has been due to a common interest in
outdoor exercises. Again, things practical, things
literal have crowded out the benignant figure of
Santa Claus; and in the stead, the comic supplement
of the Sunday newspaper furnishes pictures that well-nigh
stifle the true domain once occupied by “Mother
Goose.”</p>

<p>What would a parent do, asked suddenly to deal
with a promiscuous collection of juvenile books?
Would she unerringly reach forth for the volume
most likely to please her son’s or her daughter’s
taste? If she were to claim little difference between
the one college story she had read, and the several
hundred she had not read, she would not be far from
wrong. But we cannot tell how deep an impression
the present activity among writers for children
will have on the future. Our temptation is to
make the general statement that the energy is a
surface one, that no great writing is being done for
children because it has become an accessory rather
than an end in itself. Education saved us from the
moral pose; it must not deny us the realm of imagination
and fancy.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Children’s Books: Their Classification;
Their Characteristics.</span></h3>

<p>There is nothing more variegated in its colour
than a large assemblage of children’s books;
the cover-designers revel in their rainbow conceits,
sprinkling gold across the cloth as generously as
fairies scatter star-dust; the artists fill their brushes
with delicate tints of red and blue and orange, and
sketch the progress of a story in spiral traceries of
imagination. The mechanical perfection of book-making
is genuinely pleasing; the form, like that
of the glass-blown vase with its slender outlines, is
fitted for the worthiest content. The excellence of
binding, the distinctness of type, the spirit of the
drawing—these points strike our senses, these are
the subterfuges of the publishing trade, these the
artistic features that hide the shallowness beneath.
You may arrange your blue books together, and
your red, your brown, your white or green in rows;
you may mix them all up again, and marshal them
in regiments of equal sizes; the persistent query
stares you in the face,—the stinging fact of ignorance—what
of the story you are about to buy?</p>

<p>In the public library, the shelves are empty; you
are told, as the librarian, to fill them. Not for yourself
alone is the choice to be made, or even for your
own children, whom you are supposed to know;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
but for every one who wishes to read. You have
little right to assume much homogeneity of taste
or desire among young folks; you must balance
your dreams with facts, your ideals with human
accomplishment. We are all as grains of sand in
the general scheme of the universe; we are all supposed
to have equal chances before the law; but
what we are is the measure of what we read. You
are the custodian of a public trust, not of your
private book-case. A row of children—the poor by
the side of the rich, the newsboy by the side of the
patrician—you are to supply them every one. Have
you then the privilege of assuming an autocratic
policy of exclusion? Can you say to yourself,
The newsboy must read Homer!—and refrain from
buying him his penny-dreadful?</p>

<p>Each man’s standard of excellence differs from
his neighbour’s. Matthew Arnold’s idea of the
best ignored your opinion and mine. The world
has put a face value on certain books; they live
because the universal in them and the universal in
us is constant and persistent. And though we each
stand upon a different pivot of existence, though
the wind blows with less fury around you than around
me, on calm nights we may each see the same star,
however different the angle of vision.</p>

<p>So, are you not here furnished a starting-point in
your purchases? Where you are concerned with
children, your opportunity is richer by far than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
you first imagined. They have no preconceived
notions; they stand in a general mystery of dawning
experience; they know not how or why; all truth
is a fable before them. Common things are apparelled
in celestial light; nature is governed by
omnipotence; creation is the first meeting with
Aladdin’s lamp. The common law of growth tells
us this; our knowledge of men is carved from such
general mystery; our method of gaining this experience
is higher than we wot of; the father is
judged in terms of King Arthur before he is reckoned
with as a man.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is your bounden duty to satisfy these
several stages. You must have pictures for the
little ones that will cater to a familiarity with common
things, and will satisfy a tendency in them to make
all nature animate.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> You must find an artist capable
of seeing the significance, the humour of the dish
running after the spoon. There must be picture-books
that will treat of these things with all the
purity they deserve; high-mindedness is an essential
part of elemental fun. The nursery claims a part
in your plan. Place, then, first upon your list, the best
picture-books and jingles. Let true art supplant the
comic supplement sheet.</p>

<p>We will banish the use of baffling terms in speaking
of the classes of juvenile books. Our Fiction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
will become Stories; our Myths and Folk-lore and
Fables simply Fairy Tales and Legends. Our arrangement
now assumes a definite perspective, from
the limitless past to ourselves as the fixed point.
Our standard is one of interest; we will apply the
test of excellence, not to books generally, but to each
channel in which individual interest has a right
to seek its own development. By a psychological
consideration, we are able to hitch our wagon to a
star, to span the distance separating the Present
and the Past, the Real and the Ideal. Myth flows
imperceptibly into legend; and, with all the massive
proportions of the heroic, legend enters and becomes
part of history. And history is vitalised only when
we present it to children in the form of biography.
Is it not Carlyle who defines history as the biography
of great men?</p>

<p>Thus, we add still more to the positive factors
in our book selecting. We will not disguise for the
child the true character of a volume by a nomenclature
which is indefinite. Better the terms “How We
Are Governed” than “Civics”; and “How to Make
Things” than “Manual Training.” We will satisfy
all tastes by the best to be had, and that rule shall be
proverbial. The boy, deprived of his dime novel,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
must be given something just as daring, just as
redolent with sensationalism; but we will transfer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
his den of thieves from the <span id='cor_171'>areaway</span> to the broad
green forest, and his profession of robbery shall
grow into outlawry; his Jesse James become Robin
Hood. Some of the best literature contains the
quality of sensationalism; it is the form that the
dime novel has taken, and the cheap exploitation of
filthy detail, that have obscured many of the most
beneficial elements in melodrama. The Adventures
of Ulysses, the Twelve Labours of Hercules, Daniel
in the Lion’s Den, Jonathan and David—the green
lights are not far away.</p>

<p>Have you ever watched the breathlessness of a
messenger boy with his “Ragged Dick Series”;
the intent, eager faces in the gallery of the theatre
during a melodrama? Nine times out of ten,
morals are not being perverted; crime is not being
glorified, but severely punished; chivalry is acting
in shirt-sleeves; the good is winning its just deserts
in a large way, and the boy glows. Not
that I would have our libraries circulate “Ragged
Dick,” but there is more to remember in such
stimulation, there is more <em>effect</em> than will ever be
drawn from the conventional tale with its customary
noble and ignoble heroes. The amount of inane
fiction concocted for children is pernicious.</p>

<p>Literature has been made cold to the child, yet
there is nothing warmer than a classic, when
properly handled. Each man lives in his own age;
we are creatures of timeliness, but we see the clearer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
for being at times on the mountain peak. The
traveller from an antique land is part of our experience
quite as much as the man around the corner.
What I contend is that the attraction, the appeal
of a story depends largely on the telling. With a
broad sweep of right emotion, we must be taught
to soar, and there must be no penalty of arrest for
wishing to o’erleap the false horizon of a city skyline.
The tenement boy is a dreamer, even though
he perforce must lay his cheek against the rough
brick of an air-shaft and squint up at the stars.
The democracy of a public library system affords
him equal opportunities with Keats—even though
he may not have the same capacity for enjoyment—to
look into Chapman’s Homer; he is entitled to all
that vast experience, that same “hoard of goodly
states and kingdoms.” But if his author is not
deep-browed, if he, too, is not given the same pure
serenity of view, if his Chapman does not speak out
loud and bold, he will feel himself defrauded of the
vitalising meaning of literature, he will have missed
being</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">... like some watcher of the skies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When a new planet swims into his ken.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This, therefore, should make you determine to cry
against mediocrity; to purchase for those empty
shelves the best of a class, the best of an edition,
and the most authentic of texts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>Lady Eastlake once wrote: “The real secret of a
child’s book consists not merely in its being less
dry and less difficult, but more rich in interest, more
true to nature, more exquisite in art, more abundant
in every quality that replies to childhood’s keener
and fresher perceptions. Such being the case, the
best of juvenile reading will be found in libraries
belonging to their elders, while the best juvenile
writing will not fail to delight those who are no
longer children. ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ the standing
favourite of above a century, was not originally
written for children; and Sir Walter Scott’s ‘Tales
of a Grandfather,’ addressed solely to them, are
the pleasure and profit of every age, from childhood
upward. Our little friends tear Pope’s
‘Odyssey’ from mamma’s hands, while she takes
up their ‘Agathos’<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> with an admiration which no
child’s can exceed.”</p>

<p>The opinion here quoted somewhat overstates the
real case. The experienced librarian of to-day
could tell a different tale from the loan desk; it is
the average young person she must have in mind,
and the average understanding. But this understanding
is not commensurate with the reading
ability of the child; it is much above it, and this fact
also should be considered an asset for the librarian
to work with. Despite the theories regarding how
a story should be told to a seven-year-old reader, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
to one twelve years old, the volumes do not very consistently
adapt themselves to such a classification.
The buyer must say: Is it to be read <em>by</em> the child?
Consider his schooling. Is it to be read <em>to</em> the child?
Consider his understanding.</p>

<p>Let us not subject ourselves to the criticism that
our ideals will not work. If they are unpractical,
they are useless and must be amended. It is recognised
that something more is wanted than the
“masterpiece,” so guardedly extolled by Mr. Everett
T. Tomlinson,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a popular author of boys’ books.
He separates the boy and the classic by a wide gulf
of adolescent requirements; he pleads for something
in addition to bone and tendon; he believes the
boy demands material to fit his mental estate, which
is not equipped for “ready response” to adult
literature. In other words, the juvenile book of
to-day, which is well typified by his own stories, is
to supplement and not to supplant the “masterpiece.”</p>

<p>The situation is a rather delicate and uncertain
one; it would be well, as Mr. Tomlinson suggests,
if the results, as he thinks, were actually the case.
But does the girl, who reads her “series” trilogy,
slip from Dinsmore into Dickens; or does the
boy, with his Henty books filling shelf after shelf,
graduate therefrom into Scott? The theory does
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
not work, and, even if it did, an immense amount
of energy is going to waste somewhere. Miss Hewins,
from her extensive experience as a worker in
the Hartford Public Library, has outlined what you
can get from a Henty book [Wisconsin Library
Bulletin. Madison, Sept.-Oct., 1906. Vol. 2, No.
5.]; her plan is most interesting, and, were there
readers possessing the zeal necessary to make such
literature permanently serviceable, we could actually
view knowledge growing from more to more. The
summary is as follows:</p>

<p>“If a boy reads nothing but Henty for a year or
so, he is not likely to care for the great historical
novels of the world later, but if he uses him under
guidance, reading after each one of his books a
better story of the same period, if he look up places
on a map, unfamiliar words and references in a
dictionary or cyclopædia, and if he reads a life of
one of the real characters in every book, he is well
on his way to an intelligent interest in general
history.”</p>

<p>But would it not be just as well to centre this
concentration directly on Scott? The librarian will
doubtless claim that the boy turns more readily to
the one than to the other, and I believe that this is
largely due to the over-emphasis of Scott as a standard
author, and of Henty as a popular writer for
boys. Scott has never been issued in form to catch
the young reader’s eye. Given as many illustrations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
as Henty, relegating the preface to the appendix,
or omitting it altogether, and the author of “Waverley”
would be found to have lost none of his grip.
You will receive from any librarian the unfailing
statement that one of the most constant ambitions
is to reduce the proportion of fiction in circulation,
and, in that proportion, to preserve what is of true
worth in place of the mediocre average of the modern
story-books.</p>

<p>Mr. Tomlinson’s analysis of the qualities in
a child’s book may be indicated by seven divisions:</p>

<ol class='biblist'>
<li>There must be a story.</li>

<li>There must be vigorous action with little contemplation.
“Analysis and introspection are
words outside of his [the child’s] vocabulary,”
says Mr. Tomlinson.</li>

<li>Fancy is more to be sought for than pure imagination.</li>

<li>The writer must regard the moral character of
boys: a lack of mercy, a strict sense of justice;
he must regard their faith which is credulity;
their sentiment of reverence; their power of
being convinced.</li>

<li>The writer must likewise consider the differences
between the sexes in the point of moral
faculties, even though in many respects they
are the same. For girls have tender consciences,
though not so tenacious; they are
quick to promise, and as quick to forget; they
are easily stirred to pity, their sympathy easily
appealed to. Bringing it down to an animalistic
basis, Mr. Tomlinson believes that though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
the ancestral cruelty in girls is not so evident
as in boys, when it does flash forth it is sharper
in every way. “To both, right and wrong are
absolute, not relative terms, and a youthful
misanthrope is as much of an anomaly as a
youthful grandfather.”</li>

<li>The sentiments must be directed in channels
of usefulness and power, hence the story of
patriotism, the situation of courage, the incident
of tenderness.</li>

<li>Since the faculties in action are receptive,
rather than perceptive, since the memory is
keen to hold, the writer must bear this psychological
status in mind.</li>
</ol>

<p>In fine, recognising that even in his play the boy
takes things seriously, and believing that the juvenile
intellect “seeks the reasonable more than the process
of reasoning,” Mr. Tomlinson shapes a dicta of
criticism, a standard by which the child’s book
may be recognised in terms of vital characteristics.
Apply them to recent juvenile books, if you will, and
you will find the majority wanting. But will not the
classics meet these requirements? Are we to
relegate the best we have to the back shelves, and
buy nothing that smacks of good style? Instead
of putting tight bands of expectancy about our
minds, and of making us bow down before a throne
of iced classics, let the librarian treat the “Iliad”
genially, let her represent “Siegfried” with the
broad heavens above him. The classics have
<em>yielding</em> power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>It is characteristic of every age that a discontent
is always manifest with the conditions as they exist
at the time. As early as 1844, the child’s book, <i lang='la'>per
se</i>, was brought under rigourous scrutiny by an unnamed
critic in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, and what
was said then applies equally as well to the state
of affairs to-day. But this very entertaining writer,
talking in terms of judgment founded upon a keen
understanding of what such a book should be, attempts
a list of juvenile books which bears all the
ear-marks of his age; he finds it necessary to select
from the immediate supply; he knows that there is
the author of his own era whom he cannot discard.
We have a lurking suspicion that, with his canons of
criticism, he would have altered his list, could he
have looked in perspective. But there was very
little range in children’s books of that day; the
species was just becoming accentuated, and his
element of <em>timeliness</em> had to be regarded. Therefore,
while we are pleading with the librarian for a high
choice in the selection of books, we know that were
the <em>timely</em> volume omitted, simply on the basis that
it did not conform with one’s idea of the best, the
library would become fixed, like a dead language.
The <cite>Quarterly</cite> article was written at a time when
the secularisation of juvenile literature was just
beginning to take place; the moral and the educational
factors were looking askance, the one at the
other, both claiming the boy and girl for instruction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
but each from a different basis. Our author pleads
for the healthy, normal reader, in whom “still-born”
knowledge—mere lifeless acquisition—were a curse
indeed! He cries out against the educational catechism,
as he does against the moral one. His
discriminating thesis advances in threefold manner,
for he writes:</p>

<p>“Those who insist on keeping the sense of enjoyment
rigidly back, till that of comprehension has
been forcibly urged forward—who stipulate that
the one shall not be indulged till the other be appeased—are
in reality but retarding what they most
affect to promote.”</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>“Children have no sooner begun to enjoy than
they are called upon to reflect; they have no sooner
begun to forget that there exists in the world such a
little being as themselves than they are pulled back
to remember, not only what they are, but what they
will one day infallibly become.”</p>

<p>And still again:</p>

<p>“Children seem to possess an inherent conviction
that when the hole is big enough for the cat, no
smaller one at the side is needed for the kitten.
They do not really care for ‘Glimpses’ of this, or
‘Gleanings’ of that, or ‘Footsteps’ to the other—they
would rather stretch and pull....”</p>

<p>From a desert of dust-covered magazines, this
comes to us like a hidden spring bubbling with energy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
which no outer crust of years can quell.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Then as
now, they had the pernicious school-book—instance
Peter Parley;<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> then as now, they had the flippant
tale. Our unknown author recommended “Puss in
Boots,” with designs by Otto Specker, as the beau ideal
of nursery books, and the Grimm Tales with Cruikshank’s
illustrations; he recognised the admirable
qualities in the verses by the Taylor sisters. Miss
Edgeworth, Miss Tytler, Mrs. Barbauld, Mrs. Hofland,
Mary Howitt (although some of her books are
questioned), Catherine Sinclair, Mrs. Marcet, and
a host of others, now dead to the circulating shelves,
received their quota of commendation. The list
is a curious example of existing circumstances; it
illustrates the futility of crystallising the library
system; it demonstrates that the library, as an institution,
must reflect the aspirations of its age, not
overreaching its full capacity of usefulness and of
average excellence.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Library, The School, The Home: 
A Plea for Culture.</span></h3>

<p>“Criticism,” says Matthew Arnold, “must maintain
its independence of the practical spirit and its
aims. Even with well-meant efforts of the practical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
spirit it must express dissatisfaction, if in the sphere
of the ideal they seem <span id='cor_181'>impoverishing</span> and limiting.”
Still, not for a moment are we able to lose sight of
the active working conditions of the library. Speculation
as to the functions of such an institution in a
community may lead to the formulation of certain
ideals which are to guide the practical machinery
in the future. But, on the instant, there is the urgent
necessity of supply and demand; the theorist must
cope with the actual reader calling for a book.</p>

<p>It is, however, only proper to expect that human
activity be directed, not along the lines of least
resistance, but along the lines of best results. This
infers that the library, as an institution, fully recognises
that it has a function to perform in society,
and that it will strive, in its several capacities, so
to unify its activities that it will become a force as
well as a convenience.</p>

<p>Through pleasure, we would train the child to
future usefulness; physically we would let him find
expression for all his surplus energy; but as a reader,
we would so far guide him that none of his mental
energy will go to waste. Intellectually, a boy or a
girl should not be given what one library called
“leisure hour reading”; a book should not mean,
for either, a vehicle for frittering the time away, but
their training should lead to the finding of “tongues
in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in
stones, and good in everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>An essential purpose is a most important element
in the future history of children’s rooms, and at the
present initial stage it were unwise to criticise the
methods by which the library is trying to state this
purpose in definite terms. But whether we regard
its activity in the direction of the home, the school,
the settlement, or the city at large, we may safely
claim that its main duty in all directions is to supply
the best books to be had on any stated line. And
herein we discover the connection that ought to exist
<span id='cor_182'>between</span> our schools as educational, and our libraries
as cultural centres. In Buffalo, Mr. Melvil Dewey,
during an address given to teachers, said:</p>

<p>“By law, the children are put under your influence
in their earlier years, when, if ever, they can
be taught to love good books so well that in all their
lives thereafter they will seize on every opportunity
to read them. If the librarians, with their wing of
the educational army, can select and catalogue and
provide free of cost the best on every subject, the
schoolmen, with their wing and with their immensely
larger resources both of money and men—and still
better, of devoted women—must send out from
the schools, year by year, boys and girls who will
be lifelong patrons of the public library, and will,
in due time, help to send their own children along
the paths which have proved for them so profitable
and pleasant; ... but its great work should be
the partial recognition that education is no longer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
for youth and for a limited course, in a school to
which they give most of their time, but that it is
really a matter for adults as well as youth, for life
and not for the course, to be carried on at home as
well as in the schools, and to be taken up in the
hours or minutes of leisure, as the proper accompaniment
of their regular business or labour. This
means that education must be carried on by means
of reading, and that, if the librarians are to furnish
the books and give all necessary help in their
proper field, the schools must furnish the readers.”</p>

<p>It is, therefore, the supreme function of a supervisor
of school libraries to reconcile culture with
knowledge-getting—taste and desire with mental
training—quite as much as it is his official duty to
furnish supplementary books for the class-rooms.
In fact, the former should become his chief
business, for in the other capacity he slightly encroaches
upon, rather than aids—duplicates in expense,
rather than enforces by supplying a need—the
work being done by the neighbourhood
library.</p>

<p>Between the school and the library there should
thus be a reciprocal interchange of courtesies, the
sum total of which tends toward culture.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> For the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
child is the potential man, and in our reading, despite
the opportunities for education, we are not made
to understand, at the early age when habits are
most readily formed, the real import of the sustaining
power of art.</p>

<p>The reading of novels is a delightful recreation;
it is not the reading which should be questioned; it
is the power to stop. Periods of rest are a psychological
necessity, but it is the power of returning
from the side issue to the life issue, which, in so
many cases, is the missing element. The literature
that does nothing more than amuse is not the literature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
which, in future days, one is to fall back on as
a maintaining force. Browning cries out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">I count life just a stuff</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To try the soul’s strength on, educe the man.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The man of culture is something more than an upstart;
his is a slow but a steady growth; the smallest
star that burns into the night is one whose rays have
taken years to reach the earth. Out of the varied
but unified elements, the personality evolves its view
of life; it may not necessarily be a life among books;
Shakespeare the man and Shakespeare the poet are
contradictions. The sustaining force in literature
is no protector in the sense that it shields us from
some impending danger. It settles behind us, pushes
us, heart and soul, with a burning resolution,
through the darkest night. The cultured man finds
himself clinging to the sunnier side of doubt, not
because Tennyson advises it, but because it has become
part of his philosophy; he falls back upon a
part of himself developed by literature.</p>

<p>Our neighbour is but a composite picture of
numberless developments, all working toward a
definite goal. We call him the cultured man. Our
neighbour is one who tries to show us as many
pictures of himself, working in different directions, as
he thinks will clothe him in a mist of thought. We
call him the dilettante. Dilettanteism does not sustain;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
we either have to be perfectly honest with ourselves,
or else be discovered by others in the end.</p>

<p>The habit of association with good books is, therefore,
one which our school systems need to inculcate.
The supervisor of class-room libraries should
strive to supplement the text-book with something
that is not a <span id='cor_186'>text-book</span>; the outlines of history
should be strengthened by <i lang='la'>bona fide</i> biography instead
of by the hybrid type of fiction. A committee
in Germany, after working some years over the recommendations
of books for children, finally printed
a list of 637 volumes—calling attention to a weakness
in travel, popular science, and biography. This
condition is as true in England and America; and
one of the causes for the deficiency may be accounted
for by the substitution of the text-book style for the
dignified narrative. The writer of juvenile books,
other than fiction, has not realised, up to the present
time, that the direct treatment is capable of being
understood by young people.</p>

<p>Conscious of this weakness, the librarian in time
will banish from the circulating shelves the text-book,
<i lang='la'>per se</i>; and the school child should be prepared
to meet the change. If he is given instruction in
the uses of a dictionary,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and of a card catalogue;
if he is trained by degrees to hunt up references—he
should as well be familiarized with the transition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
from text-book to authority, from selection to source,
from part to whole. From the mere usefulness of
books he should be taught the attractive power
of books. This, it would seem, is one of the fundamental
relations existing between the library and
the school.</p>

<p>With the increase of facilities, with the specialised
consideration paid to children’s reading by librarian
and by teacher, there arises the factor of the parent
in connection with the two. What part, in the
general plan, does the home occupy? It furnishes
the scholar; it furnishes the reader. In private
instruction, it may dictate what shall be taught to
the boy or girl; in public instruction, the individual
becomes part of the system. The home may purchase
books for the particular taste of this child or
of that, but the public library must attend to <em>all</em>
demands. Because of its democratic mission, it
partially discourages the private ownership of books
by the average person. Therefore, in most essentials,
the State furnishes the means of instruction and
indicates what that instruction shall be in its elementary
stages; the State likewise supports the
library, a repository where the regulation and
censorship are minimised as far as the reader is
concerned.</p>

<p>Let us acknowledge the peculiar social and economic
conditions that conduce to deprive the home
of the means or of the time to give to the proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
training of children: the crowded tenement, the
isolated mountain cabin are alike in this denial.
But the school and the library are counteracting the
deficiency. The mental condition in the tenement
is more in a state of ferment than in the mountains;
the second generation of the ignorant emigrant in
New York or Chicago or Cleveland or Pittsburg is
far more fortunate than the new generation peopling
our Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. Yet the
school and the library are penetrating the dense
maze—they are defying isolation, and we will doubtless
discover, before long, that the stagnation throughout
the Tennessee ranges, and bordering the northern
line of the Shenandoah Valley, has beneath it a great
potential future of intellectual development. Until
the social settlement passes through its experimental
stage,—perhaps its very existence is dependent upon
its experimental character—it were not safe to speculate
on how largely it will aid in making the home
so far independent of consuming necessity that it
will respect the refinements of life, and will recognise
that, in so doing, each individual raises his own
self-respect. Should the settlement accomplish this,
however little, it will justify its existence.</p>

<p>The home, none the less, remains a factor, and
its responsibility is none the less urgent. The story
hour is one of its legacies from the past, and through
it, the parent should cater wisely to a child’s desire
for a tale. If the library is also adopting the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
means, this in no way should relieve the parent of
the prerogative; it should only afford her an opportunity
of improving upon her own idea as to how a
story should be told. Home influence should direct
this juvenile desire, this individual taste; for no one
has the close knowledge of a boy or girl possessed
by the father or mother.</p>

<p>The habit of good reading, mentioned before,
should be the joint product of the library, the school,
and the home. Yet, in many instances, the library
card of the child is of small consideration to the
parent. This is more likely due to indifference than
to an absolute confidence in the library’s effort to
bring juvenile readers in contact with the best
books. The woman’s club that will study the
problem of children’s reading, as sedulously as it
analyses the pathologic significance of Ibsen’s
heroines, will be rendering a service to the library, as
well as fitting its members to pass some judgment
on the publisher’s yearly output of juvenile books.</p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Book-lists and Book-selecting.</span></h3>

<p>“Shall we permit our children,” wrote Plato in the
“Republic,” “without scruple to hear any fables composed
by any authors indifferently, and so to receive
into their minds opinions generally the reverse of
those which, when they are grown to manhood, we
shall think they ought to entertain?” To a negative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
reply from Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, Plato
continued: “Then apparently our first duty will be
to exercise a superintendence over the authors of
fables, selecting their good productions, and rejecting
the bad. And the selected fables we shall
advise our nurses and mothers to repeat to their
children, that they may thus mould their minds
with the fables, even more than they shape their
bodies with the hand.”</p>

<p>Upon the broad principles here formulated the
value of the children’s rooms depends. For it will
be conceded that the two requisites of a library are
to place good books upon the shelves and to see that
they are read.</p>

<p>In the first section of this chapter, the individual
promptings of a conscientious person were suggested;
but a more systematic method of book-selection
should be adopted, whereby a book is chosen because
it has passed scrutiny of a committee elected
for the special purpose. In order to protect the
average demand, such a board should, of necessity,
be a body catholic in taste, and not wholly academic
in tone. It should bear in mind that a consulting
library is different in function and in appeal
from the general circulating branches; that the specialised
critic must pass, not always upon whether
there is sufficient fact in the book, but upon whether
what fact there is has been dealt with truly, rather
than fully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>As early as 1893, Paul Ziegler established a German
monthly, the <cite>Jugendschriftenwarte</cite>, in which
he purposed to teach the German people how to
examine children’s books, classical and modern.
He believed firmly that he would be able to reach
some scientific basis, some consistent standard,
which would be founded upon psychological, pedagogical,
and æsthetic experience. This ambitious
beginning by Ziegler led to the organisation of
committees for the same purpose. In 1900, there
were twenty-six centres throughout the Empire engaged
in the study, and they were soon gathered
together by Heinrich Wolgast,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> a specialist on the
subject of children’s reading, into a “union” called
“Die vereinigten deutschen <span id='cor_191'>Prüfungsausschüsse</span>
für Jugendschriften.”</p>

<p>By 1906, the movement had so grown that seventy-eight
local committees, with a common interest and a
strong organisation, were working in twenty-six German
States, their energy being felt and their example
being followed in Austria, Switzerland, and France.</p>

<p>These committees have been weeding out, according
to their æsthetic, educational, and national
ideals, all undesirable literature for children, leaving
nothing but the best. It would appear that in the
course of their examination they called into account
the opinions of parent, teacher, librarian, author,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
illustrator, and publisher. The local committees,
working in hearty sympathy with the local libraries,
had but one watchword, <em>excellent</em>; the book was read
three times by a number of committees—sometimes
as many as six, when the book would pass through
eighteen hands. If a committee’s decision was
unanimous, the result was sent to the central office of
the confederation; if there was a difference of opinion,
an arbitrator was called in.</p>

<p>Miss Isabel Chadburn, in a suggestive article,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
quotes fully some of the final reports which are always
sent to the <cite>Jugendschriftenwarte</cite> for publication.
Here is one dealing summarily with a book:</p>

<p>“‘The Lifeboat,’ Ballantyne (From the English
of). Four pictures in colour, black-and-white illustrations
in the text; second edition; 8vo, 122 pages.
Leipzig: Otto Spamer, 1892. Price 1 m.</p>

<p>“Tested by: Berlin (no); Breslau (no); Halle (no);
Königsberg (yes); Posen (no); Stettin (yes).</p>

<p>“A story of adventure in which the interest of the
reader is directly excited through the keeping up
of a succession of extraordinary events. The
characterisation is utterly superficial and contradictory.
The style, hard to understand on account of
the numerous technical nautical terms, is full of
indistinct and distorted metaphors and expressions.
The pictures are crude and badly drawn. Upon
these grounds the book is rejected.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>By the German method, a poor book would find
small chances of surviving. Already this test has
met with opposition from the German “Union of
Booksellers, Selling on a Commission.” But the
crusade is steadily gaining ground and the influence
having effect.</p>

<p>The academic tone detected in this plan is its
one objection. Were the same policy adopted in
America, it would only add to an already over-conscious
education-getting process. As we seem
to be obsessed by the idea, far better it would be
simply to trust to a general impression of a book,
than to have it squeezed and analysed out of existence.
A teacher who served on such a board
would be obliged to cut herself completely adrift
from the school-room atmosphere, and to criticise
from a cultural standpoint, tempered by her educational
experience.</p>

<p>We have our own children to consider; European
States are sending us theirs. It is no small matter
to decide what they should read. In the library,
the juvenile member is to find a full and free development.
Russian and Polish, French, German and
Italian, Yiddish and English—all these must be
satisfied. But there is one thing positive; however
conglomerate the membership, a library for children
must assume as a fundamental maxim that the best
books alone will create the best taste.</p>

<p>We shall be obliged to come to it sooner or later,—a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
guillotine method—the wholesale eviction of all
literature which is an outgrowth of this attempt
to drag our classics down, in order to appeal condescendingly
to youthful intellects, and to foreshorten
our fiction so as to satisfy a trivial mood. Wisely,
the librarian is moving by degrees; a sudden adoption
of a rigorous standard would find an army of readers
wholly unprepared; the ideal must be made to suit
the needs of different environments. Whatever
rules are formulated to hasten the improvement,
they must be pliable and not fixed; for, though all
localities may be improving, this betterment will
be found to vary in degree with each section.</p>

<p>Having stacked the shelves, the next step is to
appeal to the child through suggestion; to find out,
as well as opportunity will permit, wherein his tastes
lie, and what class of book dominates his card, as
seen by the catalogue notation stamped upon it.
The librarian must seek to divert any miscarriage
of energy; to lead away from undesirable tendencies
by gradual substitution of something a little higher
in motive and much stronger in style. She must
resort to exciting subterfuges: the bulletin accessory,
the book-lists, the story hour—in fact, whatever her
inventive mind can shape to awaken interest, to
foster a desire for something above the average
taste.</p>

<p>There are some who approve of closing the shelves
to children, and in this way of directing the distribution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
of books to the individual. Not only is this
impracticable, but it deprives a child of that personal
contact with all kinds of books by means of which
he is to learn his own inclination. We must infer
that all books upon the juvenile shelves are placed
there because they are thought suitable for children.
The librarian may reserve that prerogative of concealing
a book and regarding it out, should a demand
for it come from one who should not, for any apparent
reason, have it. But the jurisdiction of the
librarian over the child-taste, just as the jurisdiction
of the teacher over the child-mind, ends where the
home is expected to proclaim its effectiveness and
its right.</p>


<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">The Experimental Temptation.</span></h3>

<p>Many attempts have been made to treat statistically
the reading tastes of children, but the results are
significant only in a few details, and even these vary
from locality to locality, as they differ from child to
child. The psychology of sex becomes apparent by
the manner in which boys and girls respond to the
same stimulus. But we ought not to place much
value upon a canvass of this kind, for the answers that
are sent to any class of questions are more or less
artificial, in many cases reflecting some grown
person’s estimate of a book. It is important for
the librarian to know the proportions in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
fiction and non-fiction are circulated, and what
books are in greatest demand. The temperature
changes of taste need thus to be followed. But
history deals with crucial moments.</p>

<p>Every one interested in the subject of juvenile
reading has tried to experiment and has received
quaint answers to stereotyped questions—answers
filled with humour, now and then with a spontaneous
exclamation of appreciation. In my own case,
some four hundred letters were sent to me from
children, North and South. They showed me local
variations in reading tastes; they showed me educational
weaknesses, such as a general mechanical
study of a few hackneyed poems; they showed me
an indiscriminate reading, by the <span id='cor_196'>fourteen-</span> or fifteen-year-old
girl, of fiction such as Besant’s “Children
of Gideon” and Mrs. Humphry Ward’s “Fenwick’s
Career.” Furthermore, they pointed in
some instances to individual tastes; and most of
them indicated a dire confusion as to the meaning
of the terms <em>fiction</em> and <em>non-fiction</em>.</p>

<p>By such an experiment, however, one begins to
realise how rich the field of juvenile energy is—a
stream of voluntary desire seeking some course to
the sea. From a multitude of such letters one may
comprehend why the librarian insists on proceeding
slowly in order to counteract deficiencies. The newsboy,
without his five-cent weekly, still must have his
penny-dreadful classic; the girl, too old for the juvenile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
book, must be furnished with a transitional book on
the way to the grown-up shelves; our foreign children
must be encouraged to read, according to the librarian’s
idea, something different from themselves,
something not of their own environment.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>We were warned by the writer in the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> not to regard the extremes of genius or of
dulness, in estimating children. And yet, biography
is filled with that appealing detail of juvenile taste,
which the grown person delights in recording.
Lamb’s remembrance of the Stackhouse Bible,
Coleridge’s dreamy dread of the Arabian Nights,
Scott’s lusty shouting of the ballad of Hardy Knute,
Tennyson’s spreading his arms to the sky and
chanting, “I hear a voice that’s speaking in the
wind,” Stevenson’s crooning to himself in the dark
his “songstries”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>—these touches do not betoken
the genius of men, but the genius of childhood.
Whenever we find such young people brought in contact
with children’s literature, they do not relish the
experience; they recognise as of value only that
which they can but partially comprehend, yet which
is told out of the depths of a writer’s heart and
understanding. They respond to the spirit of great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
literature from their earliest moments; for its sake,
they overcome the sensitiveness of temperament
which nowadays must be in so far reckoned with that
all causes for fear are rejected from a story. To
them, there is a certain educative value in fear.
Coleridge, timourous as he was when not more than
six, devoured the gilt-covered books of Jack-the-Giant-Killer
and of Tom Hickathrift, whom Thackeray
delighted in, not because he was so tall, but
because he was so <em>thick</em>; and though it is said that
his father burnt many of these nerve-exacting tales,
we hear Coleridge exclaiming during the course of
a lecture delivered in 1811:</p>

<p>“Give me the works which delighted my youth!
Give me the History of St. George and the Seven
Champions of Christendom, which at every leisure
moment I used to hide myself in a corner to read!
Give me the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments,
which I used to watch, till the sun shining on the
book-case approached, and, glowing full upon it,
gave me the courage to take it from the shelf.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>We interpret these remarks in terms of genius,
without giving the average mind credit for such
opinions, just because they are left unrecorded.
Every child has his night fears and his day dreams,
however regulated they may be by his social environment.
These vary in degree according to the intellectual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
energy and spiritual refinement fostered in
each one of us. The librarian’s problem is based
upon an acknowledgment of this potential energy
and refinement; she reckons with the child’s voluntary
interest. For all childhood is seeking to find
expression in numberless ways; its eye for the first
time sees the outline of life, its voice expresses for
the first time the rhythm of its nature in song. Its
compass in all things is small, but its timbre is pure.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> In a letter to the author, Mr. C. G. Leland, Superintendent
of the Bureau of Libraries, New York Board of Education, plainly
states the province and the mission of the school library. He
writes: “Nearly all of our educational institutions nowadays are
very busily engaged in supplying <em>useful information</em>. The practical
is crowding everything else out of their courses of study. The
kind of knowledge that will help in the future struggle for existence
and material betterment is being demanded more and more and
is being taught to the exclusion of much that is only ethical or
cultural.</p>

<p class='f2'>“As a continual protest against this materialistic tendency the
school library takes its position and marshals its books. Its first
purpose is to create a love for good literature and beautiful
pictures as soon as the child has mastered the mechanics of reading;
its ultimate aim is culture.</p>

<p class='f2'>“In the elementary school the library should reach to every
class-room and offer there a few very attractive and very carefully
selected books, so attractive and so well graded that the most
indifferent boy or girl will be led by easy stages into the green
fields of literature.</p>

<p class='f2'>“The class-room is still the strategic point, for even homes of
refinement are wont to delegate the work of directing the children’s
reading to the school, and the teacher with her case of well-known
books has every day opportunities denied to public librarian and
to the majority of parents.</p>

<p class='f2'>“The school library naturally points the way to the public
library; its relation to that institution is that of the preparatory
school to the university.</p>

<p class='f2'>“In supplying reference-books, and in correlating a certain
amount of recreative reading with the school course, the library
has another important field, but one which should be subordinated
to the larger and broader function.”</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Book-lists Published by Libraries.</span></h3>

<p>What principle of selection shall one adopt in
making a book-list? No hard and fast rules
can be framed, for what I may consider best may
be rejected as second best by you. There is not a
book-list issued that does not differ from the others
in many essentials; in classification, in titles, and in
purpose. Most of these lists are marked by a
sincere effort on the part of librarians to direct a
child’s reading along the best lines. But even
though they may be suggestive and helpful, at the
most they are passive and need to be supplemented
by a personal knowledge of the books recommended.
For, in the lists of history and biography, a compiler
finds it necessary to adopt many volumes that are
far from literary in the style of writing or in the manner
of treatment. To-morrow these books may
give place to others far superior and far more permanent
in value.</p>

<p>The agreement between the lists, however, does
show that there are numberless stories, legends, and
the like, which are generally acceded to be desirable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
as much because of their inherent freshness as because
of the fact that they have stood the test of
time. Rarely do the lists fail to mention them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, the recommendations issued by
the libraries usually are sent forth, hedged around by
exceptions and by indirect warnings. This is a
healthful sign; it indicates that, however intent the
maker of book-lists may be to offer the best, human
nature is not all of the same calibre, and excellence
is of an illusive character.</p>

<p>It is with some peculiar pleasure that I offer the
list of books in this Appendix, protecting myself,
and the committee that aided me, with excuses, and
forestalling criticism by claiming that while the
recommendations have been made to the best
of several abilities, and in accord with no mean
standards of selection—at the same time much has
been included of necessity which will pass away in
the years to come. This is not an exclusive list;
the attempt has been made to have it a practical,
workable list, for parents and teachers and librarians
to consult, bringing to it their own personal judgment
as to individual taste and development of the
child under consideration. Such a term as “the
child” has been used reluctantly, since there is no
other term, more human, less mechanical, to take
its place. Because of this dislike for a stereotyped
grading of childhood, the reader will here find no
indication as to age demands. The books have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
mentioned with a generous range of from six to
fifteen years.</p>

<p>Other lists will be found to include a fuller division
of subjects. Notably in the historical sections,
they will contain many more references than are
here given. Our histories smack largely of the
school-room; they do not differ so very much from
each other as to excellence; they are very apt to
agree in the zealousness with which they follow fact.
If we decide to seek for general literary merit, we
should avoid, as far as possible, the inclusion of what
we know is not the case; of what we know is intended
for the class-room.</p>

<p>And so, in order to supplement our method, which
may be considered too narrow or too broad, the
following table of available lists, which have been
brought to my notice, is included:</p>

<li>Group of Books for Schools. Librarian of

</ol>

<p class='p1'>As far as nature books are concerned, it will be
found that local differences have to be observed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
yet, though the British and American writers are
bound to these limitations, they are none the less
alike in their scope—to furnish the juvenile readers
with a ready reference guide to objects around them.
In the present instance, the list which has been compiled,
voted upon, and arranged, may suit the English
child as well as the American child, although
certain local inclusions need to be balanced by the
substitution of English counterparts. The American
school story, <i lang='la'>per se</i>, will never supplant its English
predecessor in “Tom Brown at Rugby,” or even
“The Crofton Boys.” The American library shelves
are stacked with the English make of book. And
it must be acknowledged that, in point of scholarship,
the English classics, given a library and literary
<i lang='la'>format</i>, surpass the school-book shape in every way.
In this connection, it is well to heed the warning of
Miss Moore:</p>

<p>“The choice of editions is not based upon extended
comparative work. [What is said of her list applies
as well to the present one.] It represents merely
the editions which have come to my notice, some
of them being quite unsatisfactory. This is an
era of educational publications and, while many
of these are admirably adapted to their purpose,
we have need to be constantly on our guard not
to overstock children’s libraries with books which
have no artistic merit as to cover or general make-up,
and which therefore fail to make a definite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
individual impression on the mind of the child and
give to a children’s library the general appearance
of book-shelves devoted to supplementary reading.”</p>

<p>Were this intended to be an exclusive list, many
very rigourous omissions would have been the result;
but it is better to err upon the generous side than to
appeal to an exceptional taste. “A man’s reach
should exceed his grasp” is the Browning philosophy,
but in the climb upward the intermediate tendrils
are necessary for holding on; nor must they be removed
until something is assured to take their place.
The removal of inferior books from the shelves will
not remedy the matter, unless existing circumstances
are such as to meet the case.</p>

<p>Where it is possible, the least expensive edition
has been adopted; although it is often a fact that no
choice has been given. A good edition for a library
is the most desirable, and those committees are unwise
which sacrifice quality for quantity. On the
other hand, it is unfortunate that a more suitable
arrangement cannot exist, whereby the artistic books,
which, by reason of their decorative character, are
perforce expensive, could be offered at less exorbitant
rates to an institution of such social importance
as a library.</p>

<h4>MUSIC</h4>

<p>In the preparation of this music bibliography, it
is a rare privilege to be able to include a list which
was compiled by the late Miss Mary L. Avery, of the
music department of the Lenox Library, New York;
and which was used in a lecture delivered by her
before the Pratt Institute Library School on January
12, 1900. To this, the following supplementary list,
based upon recommendation, may be added. Prices
vary.</p>

<p class='bib'><span class="smcap">Taubert, Wilhelm</span>—Klänge aus der Kinderwelt.
Schirmer.</p>

<p class='p1'>In addition, such names as Eleanor Smith and
Harvey Worthington Loomis should not be omitted,
as composers who recognise successfully the requirements
of children’s voices. These requirements
cannot be too often reiterated. In a letter to the
author, the following was underscored: “A child’s
song must be written almost entirely in the middle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
register of the voice—neither too high nor too low.
Then there must be a distinct melody for the child’s
ear to catch readily. And the words must interest the
child’s mind.” In this last respect music-teachers
are most emphatic. They appeal for verses that
stimulate the imagination, they wish words carefully
chosen; in the teaching, they seek for purity of diction,
for proper valuation of vowels, consonants,
and word-endings.</p>

<h4>FRENCH</h4>

<p>“The collection of books which we call ‘Bibliothèque
Rose’ (the paper bound edition has a pink
cover; perhaps that is the reason why we call it
Bibliothèque Rose) includes the most charming
stories a child can wish for, especially those of Mme.
de Ségur’s and Zénaïde Fleuriot’s. In this collection
as well as in the Bibliothèque des Petits Enfants, and
in the large illustrated albums, much will be found
of interest to children of from six to ten years.</p>

<p>“For older boys and girls (10–15), I would recommend
Bibliothèque des Mères de Famille. At the
present time the only thing I remember about this
collection is that there were in it a number of books
translated from the German by Emmeline Raymond,
and which used to give me much pleasure.</p>

<p>“As far as I can judge, girls and boys of this age
enjoy Jules Verne,* Charles Wagner, H. Gréville,
H. Malot, E. About, Erckmann-Chatrian,* Anatole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
France, Daudet, and La Fontaine, the two I have
starred being special favourites with boys. Of
course, I would not recommend for children everything
by these authors. I have suggested many
books in the Bibliothèque Rose; there are other
writers in that collection, such, for example, as Mme.
Cazin, Mlle. J. Gouraud, Maistre, Mayne-Reid,
Mme. Pape-Carpantier, Mme. de Stolz, and Mme.
de Witt,—all of whom have done some excellent
juvenile work. But a parent should not be satisfied
with a recommendation; personal judgment is the
surest test.</p>

<p>“Regarding poetry, there are many short pieces by
Mme. Tastu, well adapted for very young children.
In the anthologies which are published you are most
likely to find such pieces as Victor Hugo’s ‘L’enfant,’
‘Pour les pauvres,’ ‘Après la bataille’; Lamartine’s
‘L’automne,’ ‘Milly’; extracts from Corneille and
Racine; and Chateaubriand’s well-known ‘Combien
j’ai douce souvenance.’ Then there are a
number of Coppée’s poems; Bérenger’s ‘Les souvenirs
du peuple,’ and ‘A mon habit’; André
Chénier’s ‘La jeune Captive’; Hégésippe Moreau’s
‘La Voulzie’; Brizeux’s ‘La pauvre fille’; Theuriet’s
‘La Chanson du Vannier’; and poems of
Mme. Desborde-Valmore. This will give some
idea of how rich the field of poetry is, which, with
La Fontaine alone, would supply children with untold
enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“The educational value in most of the books which
I have suggested consists chiefly in the attractive
manner in which they are written; there is no ‘leçon
de morale’ in disguise in the style, yet such books
are more than well-written stories. Children read
Mme. de Ségur’s books with much more pleasure
than they do the old-fashioned Berquin’s, which
are ‘ennuyeux.’ Such stories as Mme. de Ségur
writes make a deep impression, since they teach
agreeably to love the qualities which we grown-ups
wish to see in children, and to dislike those faults
which we would blame in them, even if, sometimes,
the naughty child in the story <em>is</em> made attractive.</p>

<p>“You will see, we have no special books of animal
stories, such as you publish in England and in
America—unless you consider, of course, La Fontaine’s
fables, which do not give any practical knowledge
of animal life. Books which appeal to the
heart, or to the imagination, are very popular with
French children, who are naturally sensitive and
imaginative; but, after all, is it not so with every
child, French or English or American?</p>

<p>“It has been my experience that American children
(the very young ones), if they were able to read the
French books French children of the same age read,
enjoyed them quite as much. The difference in
national temperament develops later on. The
American boy or girl grows up more rapidly than the
French boy or girl; acquires the practical sense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
sooner; has a more real view of life. Perhaps this
is due largely to the fact that the French child has
little independence, and hence is unpractical. But
there is a compensation somewhere, for the French
child’s mind is subtler, and his imagination more
vivid. I do not think we have any library system
at present where children’s work is a specialty; in
fact, our public libraries are mostly frequented by
grown-up people. I have never seen children, as
far as I can recollect, in any of our libraries.”—<span class="smcap">Mlle.
Emilie Michel</span>, in a letter to the author.</p>

<p>Both Brentano and Dryrsen &amp; Pfeiffer (successors
to Christern), as well as W. R. Jenkins Co.,
New York, issue complete catalogues, French and
German, in which illustrated books, magazines, and
series of special volumes are suggested. They differ
so markedly in prices, that no uniformity can be
reached. But except in the case of illustrated
albums, it may be claimed, generally, that the prices
are reasonable.</p>

<h4>GERMAN</h4>

<p>In the preparation of the following German list,
the author begs to acknowledge in a general way his
indebtedness to many sources. An authority on
the subject is Wolgast, who is the author of “Vom
Kinderbuch” (Leipzig, Teubner). One of the
committee recommends the inclusion of all the stories
by Johanna Spyri; another emphasises the importance
of the work done by Ottilie Wildermuth,
and appends the following interesting account in a
letter: “‘She was the wife of a professor in Tübingen,
Swabia, and was born in 1817. She died
in 1877. Long before she thought of writing for
publication, she charmed a wide circle of friends and
acquaintances with her talent for narrating the
simple events, memories, and experiences of Swabian
life. Most of her works must be considered, not as
mere fiction, but as true pictures of the culture of
that time, and as such will be of permanent value.’
The same may be said of her children’s books,
although these are more fanciful and varied in their
subject-matter, and appeal strongly to the imagination.”</p>

<p>The Germans illustrate their A-B-C Bücher, their
Nursery Rhymes, their Bilderbücher, and their
Erzählungen in the most attractive fashion. Reference
is particularly made to Herr Richter. Fairy
Tales are read extensively by German children—and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
also by adults. Grimm, Hauff, Musäus, are
about the best. Schmitt’s Geschichten u. Erzählungen
(of which there are perhaps from one to two
hundred volumes) are excellent for boys and girls
between ten and fifteen years. The Germans have
paid such special attention to the selection and
grading of juvenile literature, that their library lists
are recommended to readers. The volumes here
mentioned are not presented with any intention of
making them definitive. Brentano will send, on
application, “Verzeichnis einer Auswahl Vorzüglicher
Bücher—Miniatur-Katalog.—Stilke, Berlin.”</p>
